ageing dide slides further and further into a state of mental illness and borderline senile dementia . from this premise , the next nineteen novels all get their central protagonists and to a certain

much commitment for fear of backing the wrong horse and losing their standing and fortune . the narrative then switches over to the macquart side of the family , whose grim working - class struggles

based paternalism ; its xenophobic prejudices , which are mitigated by instinctive humanity and dry humour ; and its shrewd common - sense understanding of personality and motivation . we see buchan s class based paternalism in the attitudes of various characters , from saskia s insistence on pointing out the former status of her russian family to phemie morran s lifelong loyalty to the extinct kennedy family , to whom she was once a domestic servant . heritage and mccunn instantly react to the first foreign resident of huntingtower , a man called leon , whose unwholesome appearance buchan describes with relish : he was a sturdy fellow in a suit of blackclothes which had not been made for him . he might have been a butler en deshabille , but for the presence of a pair of field boots into which he had tucked the ends of his trousers . the curious thing about him was his face , which was decorated with features so tiny as to give the impression of a monstrous child . each in itself was well enough formed , but eyes , nose , mouth , chin were of smallness curiously out of proportion to the head and body . such an anomaly might have been redeemed by the expression ; good - humour would have invested it with an air of agreeable farce . but there was no friendliness in the man \u2019s face . it was set like a judge \u2019s in a stony impassiveness . huntingtower chapter three . the moment when dickson mccunn relinquishes his timid wish to remain strictly inside the law and decides to take a hand against the foreign conspirators gives an ironic insight into mccunn s social conditioning , whereby the veranda is an acceptable way to break into a house and the coal hole is unacceptable . they both looked at dickson , and dickson , scarlet in the face , looked back at them . he had suddenly found the thought of a solitary march to auchenlochan intolerable . once again he was at the parting of the ways , and once more caprice determined his decision . that the coal - hole was out of the question had worked a change in his views , somehow it seemed to him less burglarious to enter by a veranda . he felt very frightened but for the moment quite resolute . i \u2019m coming with you , \u201d he said . huntingtower chapter five . in this novel buchan creates characters across a broad spectrum of scottish social classes and backgrounds , and while no one except mccunn is presented in great depth , we are given sharp and revealing character sketches of other key characters . heritage \u2019s single handed defence of the actual tower and his attempt to free - climb away from the burning building show not only his actions but his reasons and thinking , why he is doing what he is doing . wee jaikie s inner life is only hinted at occasionally , but his dogged perseverance and resourcefulness come through at several moments when his interventions are important . in the final resolution of the story , a band of adventurers ranging from an injured laird and his faithful menservants to a group of semi -

hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage , but ray steps in and publicly thanks hancock for saving his life . ray offers to improve hancock s public image , and hancock grudgingly accepts . the spokesperson convinces the alcoholic superhero to permit himself to be jailed for outstanding subpoenas so they can show los angeles how much the city really needs hancock . when the crime rate rises after hancock s incarceration , the superhero is contacted by the chief of police . reluctantly donning a new costume ( which has been provided by ray ) , hancock foils a bank robbery

asks about one of the books he sees , but mr. coreander advises against it . his curiosity piqued , bastian seizes the book , leaving a note promising to return it , and hides in the school s attic to read . the book describes the world of fantasia slowly being devoured by a force called the nothing . fantasia s ruler , the childlike empress , has fallen ill , and atreyu is tasked to discover the cure , believing that once the empress is well , the nothing will no longer be a threat . atreyu is given a medallion named the auryn that can guide and protect him in the quest . as atreyu sets out , the nothing summons gmork , a wolf - like creature , to kill atreyu . atreyu s quest directs him to the advisor morla the ancient one in the swamps of sadness . though the auryn protects atreyu , his beloved horse artax is lost to the swamp , and he continues alone . later , atreyu is surprised by the sudden appearance of morla , a giant turtle . bastian , reading , is also surprised and lets out a scream , which atreyu and morla appear to hear . morla does not have the answers atreyu seeks , but directs him to the southern oracle , ten thousand miles distant . atreyu succumbs to exhaustion trying to escape the swamps but is saved by the luckdragon falkor ( voiced by alan oppenheimer ) . falkor takes him to the home of two gnomes that live near the entrance to the southern oracle . the gnomes explain that atreyu will face various trials before reaching the oracle . atreyu proceeds to enter the oracle , and is perplexed when one second trial , a mirror that shows the viewer s true self , reveals a boy which bastian recognizes as himself . bastian throws the book aside , but after catching his breath , continues to read . atreyu eventually meets the southern oracle who tells him the only way to save the empress is to find a human child to give her a new name , beyond the boundaries of fantasia . atreyu and falkor flee before the nothing consumes the southern oracle . in flight , atreyu is knocked from falkor s back into the sea of possibilities , losing the auryn in the process . he wakes on the shore of the abandoned ruins , and finds a series of paintings depicting his quest . gmork reveals himself , having been lying in wait and explains that fantasia represents humanity s imagination , and that the nothing represents adult apathy and cynicism against it . atreyu fends off and kills gmork as the nothing begins to consume the ruins . falkor , who had managed to locate auryn , rescues atreyu in time . the two find themselves in a void with only small fragments of fantasia remaining , and fear they have failed when they spot the empress s ivory tower among the fragment . inside , atreyu apologizes for failing the empress , but she assures him he has succeeded in bringing to her a human child who has been following his quest . as the nothing begins to consume the tower , the empress pleas directly to bastian to call out her new name . bastian calls out the name he had selected , and loses consciousness . when he wakes , he finds himself in blackness with the empress , with only a grain of sand the last bit of fantasia remaining . the empress tells bastian that he has the power to bring fantasia back with his imagination using the power of the auryn . bastian re - creates fantasia , and as he flies on falkor s back , he sees the land and its inhabitants restored , and that atreyu has been reunited with artax . when falkor tells him he can wish for anything , bastian then brings falkor"], "rouge_l": [0.0035494006749679967]},

michelle monaghan ) and the bathroom mirror \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he appears to be sean fentress , a school teacher . as he comes to grips with this revelation , the train explodes , killing everyone aboard . stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit , leaking oil . communicating through a video screen , air force captain colleen goodwin ( vera farmiga ) verifies stevens ' identity , and insists he stay on mission to find the bomber before a large dirty bomb hits downtown chicago in six hours . inside the source code experimental device designed by scientist dr. rutledge ( jeffrey wright ) , he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person s life within an alternative timeline . stevens is unwillingly sent back into the source code repeatedly in frustrating , exhausting attempts to learn the bomber s identity . he tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with christina , escaping the explosion . other times he can not locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train . but rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real . it is revealed that he has been with them for two months since being reported killed in action in afghanistan . he is comatose and missing most of his body , hooked up to neural sensors . the cockpit capsule is in his imagination , his brain s way of making sense of a missing environment . a confused and frustrated stevens asks , as one soldier to another , am i dead ? angry to learn that he is on life support , he asks to be disconnected after the mission . rutledge agrees . stevens catches the bomber derek frost ( michael arden ) , who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death , and gets off at the last stop before chicago . in one run - through , frost kills both fentress and christina , and flees in a rented white van . stevens remembers the license number and direction and the authorities use this information to catch the terrorist , preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb . the mission finished , rutledge reneges on his promise , ordering goodwin to wipe stevens ' memory for a future mission . stevens convinces goodwin to allow one more try , to save everyone on the train , despite rutledge s insistence that everyone on the train had already been killed in the explosion . stevens is sent back into the source code where he disarms the bomb , subdues frost and handcuffs him to a handrail inside the train . he reports the bomber to authorities , sends an email to captain goodwin , then calls to reconcile with his estranged father under the guise of a fellow soldier . he asks christina what she would do if she knew that she only had seconds left to live , and starts to kiss her . at the same time , goodwin approaches the air - tight chamber that contains the torso of stevens ' comatose mutilated body , disconnects the life support , and stevens dies . rutledge bangs on the outer door in vain . the scene cuts to stevens finishing the kiss with christina inside the source code , revealing that the alternate timeline of the source code has become real , contrary to what was proposed by rutledge . they continue on the train , and then walk through downtown chicago to the cloud gate , a sculpture whose image stevens saw during transitions out of the source code . this prompts stevens to ask christina do you believe in fate ? as

lighter and a blackberry phone at hand . although he initially has no idea how he got there , he starts to piece together what has happened to him . he remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists , who killed his colleagues ; he was hit by a rock and passed out . he receives a call from his kidnapper , jabir , demanding that he pay a ransom of $ 5 million by 9pm or he will be left in the coffin to die . conroy calls the state department , which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists , it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him . they connect him with dan brenner , head of the hostage working group , who tells conroy they are doing their best to find him . his kidnapper calls conroy and demands he make a ransom video , threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack . conroy insists that no one will pay $ 5 million , so the kidnapper drops the amount to $ 1 million . despite his compliance in making a video , the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it , which he watches in horror . shortly afterwards , distant explosions shake the area , damaging his coffin , which begins to slowly fill with sand . conroy continues sporadic phone calls with brenner , skeptical of the man s promises of help . to reaffirm his wholehearted intentions , brenner tells conroy about a 26-year - old named mark white who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously , telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy . later on , conroy receives a phone call from his employers , who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague ( the one who was executed ) , and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company . brenner calls back and explains that the explosions that had damaged his coffin earlier were in fact several f-16 bombings , and that his kidnappers may have been killed . conroy begins to lose all hope and does a last will and testament in video form , giving his son all of his clothes and his wife his personal savings . jabir calls back demanding that conroy video record himself cutting his finger off , threatening conroy s family back home in michigan if he refuses , saying that he lost all of his children . conroy records himself cutting off one of his fingers and sends the video . shortly after making the video , the cell phone rings , paul begins to hear shovels and distorted voices . the voices come clearer , saying to open the coffin , and the coffin opens . but abruptly , it becomes obvious he hallucinated the encounter . after some minutes , brenner calls , notifying conroy that they have found his location and are driving out to find him . then conroy s wife linda calls him , so conroy hangs up on brenner . she cries with him and begs him to promise her that he will come home . he promises , but hangs up due to another call from brenner . brenner reports that they have found the site . the group starts to dig up a coffin , but conroy can not hear anyone near the coffin . when they open it , the coffin turns out to be mark white s , not conroy s , indicating that white was never rescued . paul starts to cry as he realizes he is not going to be saved . the sand fills his coffin and he suffocates to death as the light goes out and the screen goes black . the last thing we hear is brenner , repeating , i m sorry , paul"], "rouge_l": [0.006741448858926894]},

the novel contrasts the domestic characters , heroes and villains , with their more alien russian counterparts . huntingtower is characteristic of buchan \u2019s novels , particularly in its class - based paternalism ; its xenophobic prejudices , which are mitigated by instinctive humanity and dry humour ; and its shrewd common - sense understanding of personality and motivation . we see buchan s class based paternalism in the attitudes of various characters , from saskia s insistence on pointing out the former status of her russian family to phemie morran s lifelong loyalty to the extinct kennedy family , to whom she was once a domestic servant . heritage and mccunn instantly react to the first foreign resident of huntingtower , a man called leon , whose unwholesome appearance buchan describes with relish : he was a sturdy fellow in a suit of blackclothes which had not been made for him . he might have been a butler en deshabille , but for the presence of a pair of field boots into which he had tucked the ends of his trousers . the curious thing about him was his face , which was decorated with features so tiny as to give the impression of a monstrous child . each in itself was well enough formed , but eyes , nose , mouth , chin were of smallness curiously out of proportion to the head and body . such an anomaly might have been redeemed by the expression ; good - humour would have invested it with an air of agreeable farce . but there was no friendliness in the man \u2019s face . it was set like a judge \u2019s in a stony impassiveness . huntingtower chapter three . the moment when dickson mccunn relinquishes his timid wish to remain strictly inside the law and decides to take a hand against the foreign conspirators gives an ironic insight into mccunn s social conditioning , whereby the veranda is an acceptable way to break into a house and the coal hole is unacceptable . they both looked at dickson , and dickson , scarlet in the face , looked back at them . he had suddenly found the thought of a solitary march to auchenlochan intolerable . once again he was at the parting of the ways , and once more caprice determined his decision . that the coal - hole was out of the question had worked a change in his views , somehow it seemed to him less burglarious to enter by a veranda . he felt very frightened but for the moment quite resolute . i \u2019m coming with you , \u201d he said . huntingtower chapter five . in this novel buchan creates characters across a broad spectrum of scottish social classes and backgrounds , and while no one except mccunn is presented in great depth , we are given sharp and revealing character sketches of other key characters . heritage \u2019s single handed defence of the actual tower and his attempt to free - climb away from the burning building show not only his actions but his reasons and thinking , why he is doing what he is doing . wee jaikie s inner life is only hinted at occasionally , but his dogged perseverance and resourcefulness come through at several moments when his interventions are important . in the final resolution of the story , a band of adventurers ranging from an injured laird and

{"predictions": ["dave kujan flies in from new york city to interrogate verbal , who describes in flashback the events that led him and four other criminals - keaton , michael mcmanus , fred fenster and todd hockney - onto the ship . verbal explains that , six weeks earlier in new york , he and the other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped - up hijacking charge , and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police . led by keaton , a former corrupt policeman , they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy . they then went to california to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named redfoot . redfoot turned them on to another jewel heist , but the quarry turned out to be heroin , and the five had to shoot their way out . soon after , a lawyer named kobayashi contacted them and told them that keyser s\u00f6ze , a turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen ( including hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in new york ) , had offered them a job : invade a ship manned by a gang of argentinian drug dealers with whom s\u00f6ze was competing and destroy the $ 91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting . when kujan learns of s\u00f6ze from fbi agent jack baer , he questions verbal about him . verbal tells kujan an underworld legend about s\u00f6ze : that he had murdered his own family after they had been attacked by a gang of hungarian criminals , and then massacred the hungarians and everyone they held dear . he then went underground , never to be seen again , and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working . he became a fearsome urban legend , a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night . verbal goes on to explain that , after fenster had bailed on the group , kobayashi gave them a location at which to find their compatriot s dead body . they tried to kill kobayashi , but he strong - armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones . they staked out the ship and killed several argentinian and hungarian gangsters , but found no drugs on board . mcmanus , hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person , who also killed keaton and set the ship on fire as verbal looked on . verbal concludes his story , but kujan does not believe it . he insists that keaton must be s\u00f6ze , as one of the murder victims on the boat was arturo marquez , a drug dealer who escaped prosecution by claiming he could identify s\u00f6ze \u2014 and who was represented by edie finneran , keaton s lawyer and girlfriend . kujan claims that the argentinians were selling marquez to s\u00f6ze s hungarian rivals and keaton used the heist as a distraction to let him kill marquez . kujan also informs verbal that finneran has been murdered . verbal says that the entire plan was keaton s idea , but refuses to testify in court . verbal s bond is posted and he is released . moments later , kujan realizes that verbal s entire story was a lie , pieced together from details on a crowded bulletin board in his office . meanwhile , verbal walks outside , gradually dropping his limp and flexing his supposedly withered hand . as kujan runs after verbal , a fax comes in from california : a police sketch artist s rendering of s\u00f6ze , dictated by kovash , that looks exactly like verbal"], "rouge_l": [0.007602667165202219]}, "55ac84541ede6e0f1106b2e4ab01a2bac2f21e39-24": {"predictions": ["professor t. artelett aka"], "rouge_l":

precogs generate a new prediction , saying anderton will murder a man named leo crow in 36 hours . anderton does not know crow , but flees the area as witwer begins a manhunt . anderton seeks the advice of dr. iris hineman , the creator of precrime technology . she reveals that sometimes , one of the precogs , usually agatha , has a different vision than the other two , a minority report of a possible alternate future ; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system s credibility . anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence . anderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the city - wide optical recognition system . he returns to precrime and kidnaps agatha , shutting down the system , as the precogs operate as a group mind . anderton takes agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of leo crow , but none exists ; instead , agatha shows him an image of the murder of ann lively , a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049 . anderton and agatha go to crow s apartment as the 36-hour time nears , finding numerous photos of children , including sean s . crow arrives and anderton prepares to kill him , accusing him to be a serial child killer . agatha talks anderton out of shooting crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it . crow however begs to be killed , having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family s financial well being . crow grabs anderton s gun and pushes the trigger , killing himself . anderton and agatha flee to lara s house outside the city for refuge . there they learn lively was agatha s drug - addicted mother who sold her to precrime . lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim agatha , but was murdered . anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about lively s existence and her connection to agatha . witwer , studying crow s death , suspects anderton is being framed . he examines the footage of lively s murder and finds there were two attempts on her life , the first having been stopped by precrime but the second , occurring minutes later , having succeeded . witwer reports this to the director and founder of precrime , lamar burgess , but burgess responds by killing witwer using anderton s gun . with the precogs still offline , the murder is not detected . lara calls burgess to reveal that anderton is with her , and anderton is captured , accused of both murders , and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep . as his body

impacting precrime , he arranged to kill lively following an actual attempt on her life , so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within precrime and be ignored . anderton points out burgess s dilemma : if burgess kills anderton , he will be imprisoned for life , but precrime will be validated ; if he spares anderton , precrime will be discredited and shut down . anderton

led by keaton , a former corrupt policeman , they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy . they then went to california to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named redfoot . redfoot turned them on to another jewel heist , but the quarry turned out to be heroin , and the five had to shoot their way out . soon after , a lawyer named kobayashi contacted them and told them that keyser s\u00f6ze , a turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen ( including hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in new york ) , had offered them a job : invade a ship manned by a gang of argentinian drug dealers with whom s\u00f6ze was competing and destroy the $ 91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting . when kujan learns of s\u00f6ze from fbi agent jack baer , he questions verbal about him . verbal tells kujan an underworld legend about s\u00f6ze : that he had murdered his own family after they had been attacked by a gang of hungarian criminals , and then massacred the hungarians and everyone they held dear . he then went underground , never to be seen again , and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working . he became a fearsome urban legend , a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night . verbal goes on to explain that , after fenster had bailed on the group , kobayashi gave them a location at which to find their compatriot s dead body . they tried to kill kobayashi , but he strong - armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones . they staked out the ship and killed several argentinian and hungarian gangsters , but found no drugs on board . mcmanus , hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person , who also killed keaton and set the ship on fire"], "rouge_l": [0.010300574130361364]}, "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0-21": {"predictions": ["rips
