Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses . An application to list the building was refused . In April 1994 the Tate Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern . In July of the same year , an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery . Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of Herzog & de Meuron were announced as the winning architects in January 1995 . The \u00a3134 million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000 . \n \n The most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof .

Its source at the Cerro Delgado-Chalbaud , in the Parima range , was not explored until 1951 , 453 years later . The source , near the Venezuelan-Brazilian border , at 1047 m above sea level ( ) , was explored in 1951 by a joint Venezuelan\u2013French team . \n \n The Orinoco delta , and tributaries in the eastern llanos such as the Apure and Meta , were explored in the 16th century by German expeditions under Ambrosius Ehinger and his successors . In 1531 Diego de Ordaz , starting at the principal outlet in the delta , the Boca de Navios , sailed up the river to the Meta . Antonio de Berrio sailed down the Casanare to the Meta , and then down the Orinoco and back to Coro . \n \n Alexander von Humboldt explored the basin in 1800 , reporting on the pink river dolphins . He published extensively on the river 's flora and fauna . \n \n The first bridge across the Orinoco was the Angostura Bridge at Ciudad Bol\u00edvar , Venezuela , completed in 1967 . In 2006 a second bridge was completed near Ciudad Guayana , Venezuela , known as the Orinoquia Bridge . \n \n The first powerline crossing of the Orinoco was completed in 1981 for an 800 kV TL single span of 1,200 meters using two towers 110 m tall . In 1992 , an overhead power line crossing for two 400 kV-circuits was completed just west of Morocure ( between the cities of Ciudad Bolivar and Ciudad Guayana ) , north of the confluence of Routes 1 and 19 . It had three towers , and the two spans measured 2,161 m and 2,537 m respectively . \n \n Geography \n \n The course of the Orinoco forms a wide ellipsoidal arc , surrounding the Guiana Shield ; it is divided in four stretches of unequal length that roughly correspond to the longitudinal zonation of a typical large river : \n * Upper Orinoco\u2014 242 km long , from its headwaters to the rapids Raudales de Guaharibos , flows through mountainous landscape in a northwesterly direction \n * Middle Orinoco\u2014 750 km long , divided into two sectors , the first of which ca . 480 km long has a general westward direction down to the confluence with the Atabapo and Guaviare rivers at San Fernando de Atabapo ; the second flows northward , for about 270 km , along the Venezuelan - Colombian border , flanked on both sides by the westernmost granitic upwellings of the Guiana Shield which impede the development of a flood plain , to the Atures rapids near the confluence with the Meta River at Puerto Carre\u00f1o , \n *Lower Orinoco\u2014 959 km long with a well-developed alluvial plain , flows in a northeast direction , from Atures rapids down to Piacoa in front of Barrancas \n * Delta Amacuro\u2014 200 km long that empties into the Gulf of Par\u00eda and the Atlantic Ocean , a very large delta , some 22500 km2 and 370 km at its widest . \n \n At its mouth , the Orinoco forms a wide delta that branches off into hundreds of rivers and waterways that flow through of swampy forests . In the rainy season , the Orinoco can swell to a breadth of 22 km and a depth of 100 m . \n \n Most of the important Venezuelan rivers are tributaries of the Orinoco , the largest being the Caron\u00ed , which joins it at Puerto Ordaz , close to the Llovizna Falls .

In common language , words used for counting are \"  cardinal numbers \"  and words used for ordering are \"  ordinal numbers \"  . \n \n Some authors begin the natural numbers with , corresponding to the non-negative integers , whereas others start with 1 , corresponding to the positive integers . Texts that exclude zero from the natural numbers sometimes refer to the natural numbers together with zero as the whole numbers , but in other writings , that term is used instead for the integers ( including negative integers ) . \n \n The natural numbers are the basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension : the integers , by including an additive inverse ( -n ) for each natural number n ( and zero , if it is not there already , as its own additive inverse ) ; the rational numbers , by including a multiplicative inverse ( 1/n ) for each integer number n ; the real numbers by including with the rationals the ( converging ) Cauchy sequences of rationals ; the complex numbers , by including with the real numbers the unresolved square root of minus one ; and so on . These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded ( identified ) in the other number systems . \n \n Properties of the natural numbers , such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers , are studied in number theory . Problems concerning counting and ordering , such as partitioning and enumerations , are studied in combinatorics . \n \n In common language , for example in primary school , natural numbers may be called counting numbers to contrast the discreteness of counting to the continuity of measurement , established by the real numbers . \n \n The natural numbers can , at times , appear as a convenient set of names ( labels ) , that is , as what linguists call nominal numbers , foregoing many or all of the properties of being a number in a mathematical sense . \n \n History \n \n Ancient roots \n \n The most primitive method of representing a natural number is to put down a mark for each object . Later , a set of objects could be tested for equality , excess or shortage , by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set . \n \n The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers . This allowed systems to be developed for recording large numbers . The ancient Egyptians developed a powerful system of numerals with distinct hieroglyphs for 1 , 10 , and all the powers of 10 up to over 1 million . A stone carving from Karnak , dating from around 1500 BC and now at the Louvre in Paris , depicts 276 as 2 hundreds , 7 tens , and 6 ones ; and similarly for the number 4,622 . The Babylonians had a place-value system based essentially on the numerals for 1 and 10 , using base sixty , so that the symbol for sixty was the same as the symbol for one , its value being determined from context . \n \n A much later advance was the development of the idea that can be considered as a number , with its own numeral .
