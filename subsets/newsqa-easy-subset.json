One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away , text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died . I was in New York , and friends and colleagues from Chicago , Illinois , to Dallas , Texas , and Los Angeles , California , were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead . The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead , which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times . What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth , and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition . Then there is the `` rumor '' of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards . The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging . Ultimately , a source came forward and was likely paid for the information that blew the lid off of the story ; the tabloid 's editor said `` you can assume '' the Enquirer paid for it . The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened . There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet was n't able to verify the story and run with it . The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS ' `` NewsHour with Jim Lehrer '' that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself , `` When rumor arises , we 're going to need to address it . And , unfortunately , we may need to address it before we can determine whether it 's true or not because it 's having impact , as it was in this case . '' Sorry , Rick , I disagree . The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we do n't traffic in rumor and innuendo . None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control . Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications . Just check out this month 's Vanity Fair , where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns . The investment bank 's demise , some conclude , was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems , even though it was sitting on $ 18 billion . The rumors kept going and going and when the story hit the airwaves , it spread like wildfire . In one week , Bear Stearns was no more , and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth . We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story . The rules are simple : Either you have the facts or you do n't . If you do , you run with the story . If you do n't , you leave it alone . The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair . Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress . With other major media outlets turning up the heat , Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC 's Bob Woodruff . No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out , trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor . If they had , and the facts did n't support the rumor , then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more . We have an obligation to stick with the facts , and nothing else"], "f1": [0.00641025641025641], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/bbec85de1eb37c858a1821add3f428544dfaba45.story-1": {"predictions": ["30-year"], "f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true]}, "./cnn/stories/ab80b3c0497fb9ee8a1b199875953f7eaa8605ac.story-4": {"predictions": ["California 's Department of Rehabilitation"], "f1": [0.28571428571428575], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/2db9c0d8d4c2272993951b26ebd69dc0605bcf93.story-6": {"predictions": ["Zeynep Fadillioglu"], "f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true]}, "./cnn/stories/02aef53a8ae894b86d408fa90194ceaa1332ba5b.story": {"predictions": ["she had been fired upon by a small skiff"], "f1": [0], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/00eaf1c06f1e3ecd48160b43f3b3cd196a319c8a.story": {"predictions": ["organic trash is transformed into charcoal-like pellets farmers can turn into fertilizer .

Headey and Summer Glau star in `` Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . '' In the season finale of `` Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , '' John Connor , the boy destined to lead humanity 's battle against Armageddon , gets jolted into the future -- the one he was supposed to lead . But here , he has no identity . No one has heard of him . In this new future , he 'll be fighting alongside his father , his uncle and a girl who looks just like the robot he came into the future to save . None of them has any idea who he is . Confused ? Do n't be . It was a daring , surprising , brilliant cliffhanger for a show that 's gained a loyal following , particularly among people like me who are in awe of it . It also opens the door to anyone who has n't discovered this show yet , allowing for a fresh start . Unfortunately , it may be too late . For fans , the big question is whether the `` Chronicles '' will be back , or canceled for inadequate ratings . We find out in a couple of weeks when Fox announces its schedule . The speculation online does n't look good . Ending on this Season 2 cliffhanger would be a shame . When Fox picked up this `` Terminator , '' it took on one of the most successful sci-fi franchises in modern entertainment history . It courted `` Terminator '' fans , as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep , high-quality TV storytelling . Ending on this `` what happens now '' cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise 's history . But of bigger concern , of course , is that `` The Sarah Connor Chronicles '' is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last . And that 's thanks to Josh Friedman , the inspired executive producer . For him , `` Terminator '' is n't about special effects and metal monsters . It 's a family drama ; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future , no matter what the cost . Without clobbering you with messages , Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you ca n't know , about living with trauma and moving forward , about the strength and fragility of teenagers , and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children . Sarah is parental adrenaline personified . It 's also a show about cancer . We know Sarah can successfully battle robots , evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up . But will cancer ultimately do her in ?

'' I ca n't answer that . I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era . Sooner or later , all honeymoons for presidents come to an end . This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story , in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers . In the few months President Obama has been in office , the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media , too : `` Is he as good as we all hoped ? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him ? Can he get the job done ? Could anyone ? '' Democrats will add pensively to the words : `` Not Done '' from the `` SNL '' skit , `` Not yet . '' Republicans would add assertively : `` Not ever ! '' Democrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the `` Camelot II '' ; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes . Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson . Republicans have no hope left about Obama . At best , they pray , for the good of the country that he 's not as bad as Jimmy Carter . But in reality , they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure . At a time of fiscal crisis , President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him . His campaign was brilliant , and he won against two inferior campaigns , though not necessarily inferior candidates . Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president . John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition . Every president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing . Governing is tough every day . Campaigning can be fun . It 's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected . Reagan did it . Bill Clinton did it . George W. Bush did it . And this president likes to do it , and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech , coast to coast . Giving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office . No cheering there . Often in campaigns , promises are made that ca n't be kept once in office . After being elected , presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them . Sometimes voters do n't remember campaign promises and sometimes they do n't care .

His numbers on the federal deficit are also low in comparison to his approval ratings on the economy and foreign policy .

Bush stood at 62 percent in a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll in April 2001 , Bill Clinton was at 55 percent in a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll in April 1993 , George H.W.

Andre Greipel of Team Columbia edged out Belgian Wouter Weylandt and fellow German cyclists Bert Grabsch and Marcel Sieberg in a sprint finish to the rain-hit 225km leg which saw the race move from the Netherlands into Belgium . They moved clear after the main pack endured a major spill two kilometers from the end of the stage , which featured the first real climbs of the race . Switzerland 's Cancellara now has a nine-second lead over Belgian sprint specialist Tom Boonen , who moved up to second as the top 57 riders involved in the crash were given the same time as the leaders . Grabsch is third , 11 seconds off the pace , with Greipel next at the same time following his fourth-place finishes on the two previous stages . `` My goal before starting the Vuelta was to win a stage , '' Greipel told the Vuelta 's official Web site . `` I accomplished that here in Liege and now we 'll just take it one day at a time . However , I really want to direct my first words to my fellow racers in the peloton who were involved in the spill . `` I just hope everyone can continue the race . As for me , I received great support from my team and that made my job much easier .

Lars Boom of Rabobank led a breakaway from the 21km mark with Dominik Roels -LRB- Milram -RRB- , Javier Ramirez -LRB- Andalucia Cajasur -RRB- and Sergei Lagutin -LRB- Vacansoleil -RRB- , and they built a 14-minute lead by 55km . However , that was slowly trimmed to just 2:35 with 47km remaining , and then to less than two minutes after the third and final ranked climb . Once they were caught , Enrico Gasparotto of Lampre went 10 seconds clear with 10km left but was also reeled in just before the mass crash .

Greece will be required to cut civil servants ' salaries , freeze their pay increases , reduce their pension payments , change tax rates and increase the value-added tax consumers pay on purchases , according to Ilias Iliopoulos , the general secretary of the public sector union ADEDY . The International Monetary Fund did not respond immediately to a CNN request for confirmation of the value of the package .

Markets worldwide tumbled when Standard & Poor 's downgraded Greece earlier this week . It 's the first European country to fall below investment grade . What Greece 's debt rating downgrade means The downgrade -- which makes it harder and more expensive for a country to borrow money -- was a major problem for Athens as it struggles to crawl out from beneath the country 's massive debt .

'' Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years , according to NASA scientist James Hansen . Global carbon levels in the air have been steadily increasing at an alarming rate since the 1980s , according to NOAA . Since 2000 , increases of 2 parts per million of CO2 have been common , according to NOAA . During the 1980s rates increased by 1.5 ppm per year . The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products . Some of the gases given off during the process can be converted to electricity , others can be condensed and converted to gasoline , and there are also some pharmaceutical applications for the by-products , said Danny Day President and CEO of Eprida , a private firm in Athens , Georgia currently exploring industry applications for the biochar process . Although scientists look to biochar to improve the future , its origin lies in the past .

The Royal College of Physicians made the recommendation in a new report on how secondhand smoke , also called passive smoking , affects children . The report found that , for children , secondhand smoke annually causes more than 20,000 cases of lower respiratory tract infection , 120,000 cases of middle ear disease , at least 22,000 cases of wheezing and asthma , 200 cases of bacterial meningitis , and 40 sudden infant deaths . These cases generate more than 300,000 doctor visits each year and about 9,500 hospital admissions , costing the National Health Service about # 23.3 million -LRB- $ 34.9 million -RRB- each year , the report said . The findings were based on studies funded by Cancer Research UK and carried out by the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies . England 's chief medical officer , Liam Donaldson , said the report will contribute to the the government 's review of existing smoking legislation in England later this year . Smoking was made illegal in all public spaces in the United Kingdom in 2007 . `` This is a serious public health concern , '' Donaldson said . Health effects on children from secondhand smoke are `` entirely avoidable , '' the report says .

The report also urged a hike in tobacco prices , more effective health warnings , more generic packaging for tobacco products , and tailored stop-smoking services . `` This report is n't just about protecting children from passive smoking , it 's about taking smoking completely out of children 's lives , '' said John Britton , chairman of the Royal College of Physicians ' Tobacco Advisory Group .

'' But step inside their house after 4 p.m. most weekdays and you 'll want to cover your ears because of the noise -- the screaming , to be exact . These are not the shouts of sibling rivalry or parental annoyance . This is the high-pitched , ear-shattering sound of a 13-year-old girl . More accurately , it is the sound of a frustrated , irritated , very loud teenager with autism . Marissa , the middle Bilson child , was diagnosed with autism when she was a toddler . Her mother , Mary , a nurse , knew something was n't right early on , when young Marissa 's tantrums were off the charts and seemingly unwarranted . But during the first few years , doctors told Mary Bilson that her daughter was fine and this behavior would eventually pass . They were wrong on both counts . Marissa 's behavior has not passed ; it has , in fact , become worse . According to Bilson , Marissa and her tantrums rule the household . `` I do n't want to hear her screaming and tantruming , so we pretty much let her do what she wants , '' Bilson says . `` We '' means Mary , her husband , John , and their two other children , Brittany , 15 , and 6-year-old Brendan . Keeping the peace means that , when it comes to Marissa , the rules are different . She is allowed unlimited time on the one family computer . She is allowed access to her siblings ' rooms and possessions . She is allowed to eat dinner at the computer instead of the family table . Watch part one of the Bilsons ' journey '' But before you sit in judgment of the Bilsons , and suggest they just need a firm hand to keep their middle child in line , consider one thing : They are trying to cope with a child with severely impaired social sensibilities . `` Do you think people who do n't have children with autism know how tough it is to deal with them ? '' CNN 's senior medical correspondent , Elizabeth Cohen , asked Marissa 's mom in a recent interview . `` No , '' Mary Bilson replied . `` And I do n't see how they could . '' She 's right -- we ca n't , because many of us have never seen autism in action , day in and day out . Learn more about autism '' Autism is described on the National Institutes of Health Web site as a `` developmental disorder that appears in the first three years of life , and affects the brain 's normal development of social and communication skills . '' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , autism and related disorders affect about one out of every 150 babies born each year . Autism manifests itself in many different ways . Although there are some common threads , like language issues , repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others , specific behavioral patterns are largely unique to the individual . `` Children with autism are all different ; they are like snowflakes , '' explains Dr. Ronald Leaf , co-director of the group Autism Partnership . The one thing that Leaf believes they all have in common is that `` they are not expected to do enough . '' Leaf insists we have set the bar too low for what we think children and adults with autism can do . `` They are highly teachable , '' he says . `` You just have to have a good teacher . '' A good teacher is exactly what Bilson was looking for to help her with Marissa . The family had already tried various programs , starting when Marissa was a toddler -- but nothing completely worked for her . And as Marissa entered her teen years , her behavior grew worse . Mary knew that her daughter needed to be reined in , and it needed to be done now . `` She is getting older . She 's 13 and her tantrums are louder and longer than they used to be . It 's just so inappropriate . It was OK when she was much younger , but now that she 's going to be an adult soon , she ca n't be behaving this way , '' Bilson says with tired resignation . But what could the Bilsons do ? This family does n't have a lot of extra money , and most programs either are n't covered by insurance or have long waiting lists . The costs are staggering , according to the Web site FightingAutism.org . Families with autistic children can expect to spend $ 30,000 annually to provide proper medical , educational and other assistance necessary for dealing with an autistic child . Watch part two of the Bilsons ' journey '' Enter Autism Partnership , or AP . This group , founded in 1994 , offers extensive therapeutic services to children and adults with the disorder . One of its most unique programs is an intensive one-on-one , at-home intervention service that is similar in scope to what happens on the television show `` Nanny 911 . '' It 's not cheap -- about $ 2,500 per day , typically for a five-day period -LRB- with additional days on an `` as needed '' basis -RRB- . Most of AP 's work is grounded in a behavior modification technique known as Applied Behavioral Analysis or ABA . Essentially , the method breaks down behavior patterns , rewarding proper behavior while being careful not to encourage improper responses . And that is exactly how AP therapist Rick Schroeder hopes to reshape Marissa Bilson 's worst behavior . The group , which met Marissa while working in her school , offered the Bilson family a free week-long intervention with the proviso that CNN be allowed to record the process . The week started off with a day of observation -- a day with lots and lots of screaming and tantrums , that left Schroeder stunned .

'' Health.com : The 10 most depressing states in the U.S. Pan and his colleagues combined data from 28 studies dating back to the mid-1990s that included about 318,000 people overall . Roughly 2.7 % of the participants had a stroke during the studies , which ranged in length from two to 29 years . Compared to those who showed no signs of depression , people who received a depression diagnosis from a doctor or who reported feeling depressed were 45 % more likely to have a stroke and 55 % more likely to die from a stroke , the researchers found . Depression increased the risk of ischemic stroke , in which a blood vessel becomes blocked and can not send blood to the brain . But it did not measurably raise the risk of the other major type , hemorrhagic stroke , in which a blood vessel leaks or bursts open . Health.com : 12 signs of depression in men The new study is the latest in a long line of research linking depression to chronic disease and serious physical health problems . `` We knew that depression raises a person 's risk of developing diabetes , obesity , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease , '' Pan says . `` We also knew that depression can occur after patients suffer a stroke . We just did n't have strong enough evidence to know if the reverse was true , or what really comes first . '' Researchers have already established that depression increases the risk of heart attacks -LRB- and especially fatal ones -RRB- , so it makes sense that depression would have a similar association with stroke , says Norman Rosenthal , M.D. , a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine , in Washington , D.C. `` Strokes and heart attacks both represent blood vessels becoming blocked and blood being withheld from a vital organ , whether it 's the heart or the brain , '' says Rosenthal , who was not involved in the new study . `` They 're essentially the same disease .

Rosier told me that what he and the veterans discuss among themselves is very different to what is said in television interviews ; but when pushed , he describes what it 's like to kill another man . `` We could never get our fathers to talk about the first World War , because they were involved in close combat .

When the study was conducted in July , Apple 's iPad made up the vast majority of tablet computers in use in the U.S. , although Pew researchers also looked at people who used similar devices , such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab , the Motorola Xoom and even the Nook Color . The project noted several differences between tablet users and the general U.S. population . First , tablet users tend to be more highly educated : Fifty-one percent have a college degree , compared with 28 % of all Americans . Tablet users also tend to be richer : Fifth-three percent have an annual household income greater than $ 75,000 , compared with 28 % of the total U.S. population . -LRB- Conversely , 15 % of tablet users have an annual household income of less than $ 30,000 , while over a third of American households earn that much or less each year . -RRB- Most tablet users have jobs : Sixty-two percent are employed full time , compared with 41 % of the total population . Along other demographic lines , tablets mostly mirror the general population in terms of gender , race and political ideology . But age indicates some differences : Nearly half -LRB- 46 % -RRB- of tablet users are age 30-49 , while just 35 % of Americans are in that age bracket . Also , only 7 % of tablet owners are age 65 or older , while 17 % of Americans are seniors . This part of the population is growing fast as baby boomers age . Tablet users do seem to be hungry for news . The project notes : `` About half -LRB- 53 % -RRB- get news on their tablet every day , and they read long articles as well as get headlines . '' Many news organizations are building and promoting their own apps specifically designed for tablets . The project found that about two-thirds of tablet users have a news app installed on their tablets , but that 's not where they get most of their news , even on the tablet . `` The browser , carried over from the desktop experience , is still the more popular means of consuming news , '' said the report . `` A plurality of tablet news users -LRB- 40 % -RRB- say they get their news mainly through

This is the day for which so many prayed , so many marched and so many more sacrificed . This is a day of jubilation and celebration . This is the day to rejoice and recommit ourselves to restoring the American dream for us all . Barack Obama 's election offers our country the opportunity to open a new chapter that will allow us to turn the corner on past prejudices and racial politics . When Sen. Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007 , most people , black and white , thought it would be , at best , an interesting sideshow . After Obama 's victories in the early primaries , there came the controversial videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an Obama candidacy . But the senator moved quickly to reassure people that Wright 's jaundiced view of America did not reflect his own . Americans wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division . Obama understood that . And so did the voters . But African-Americans did n't believe it . Seventy-one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime , according to a national poll released in November by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. . Yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible . Obama did not just win the caucuses in Iowa -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it . Other primary victories , once thought improbable , soon followed . These included Georgia , and Virginia , the former seat of the Confederacy . On Election Day , Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did in 2004 , though he did not get a majority of whites . Unlike other black presidential candidates before him , Obama did not run as `` the black candidate . '' He ran as a Democratic candidate , a U.S. senator from Illinois , and a progressive . And America , by larger margins than in previous recent elections , voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial . For too long , race has been the stain on the American fabric . As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us , race has been our `` nation 's birth defect . '' At times during the long primary and general election , race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue . Nor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama . The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin . A lot of lessons were taught November 4 . Obama 's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans : White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were ; a solution to our country 's lingering racial problem may eventually be found ; and the Rev. Martin Luther King 's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach . Obama 's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States . `` A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country 's racial problems will eventually be found , '' said CNN polling director Keating Holland . `` In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993 , black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape . Even in the most recent polls taken last week , a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country 's racial problems could be within reach ; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end . '' Yes , of course , racism still exists in America . But if a black man can become president of the United States of America , then are n't all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves ? So on this day , let us all rejoice and be glad . Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground . Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America , as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations , dies the same death it did in the November ballot box . What our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev. King fought and died for , we are perhaps finally ready to achieve . This is a remarkable moment . Though not the apex we need to reach , it is still a mountaintop , alive with possibilities , a dream no longer deferred .

Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day , but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process , according to The Ecologist . There are a lot of them , too . You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land , according to NatureWatch , their population doubling in size every one-two months . And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves , stems and dead roots in one year , ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process . What they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients . According to NatureWatch , earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen , seven times as much phosphorous , 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more `` beneficial bacteria '' than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place . Literally speaking , what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out . Utilizing ` black gold ' It is no surprise why these worms ' byproducts are often referred to as `` black gold , '' this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world 's agricultural soil has become `` seriously degraded , '' according to the UK Soil Association . Worm compost : Just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days , according to ScienceDaily . And plants love it . Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting , by as much as 40 percent for broccoli , 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots , according to The Ecologist . According to the World Waste Survey , compiled by Veolia Environmental Services , we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004 . And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted . Around 32 percent of the European Union 's annual municipal waste -LRB- around 120 million tons -RRB- is food and garden waste , according to Waste Management World . And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000 , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill , emitting methane into the atmosphere . As local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste , vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places . In Hong Kong , none other than fast-food chain McDonald 's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day , according to the Reuters news service . McDonald 's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to Hong Kong 's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent , Reuters reports .

The Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain , Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory .

If the WMSC considers that its design was influenced by confidential Ferrari data , then sanctions may be imposed on the team for the 2008 season . McLaren team chief Ron Dennis arrives for the hearing in Paris . In an official press statement , the FIA stated : `` The WMSC has stripped Vodafone McLaren Mercedes of all constructor points in the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship and the team can score no points for the remainder of the season . `` Furthermore , the team will pay a fine equal to $ 100m , less the FOM -LSB- Formula One Management -RSB- income lost as a result of the points deduction . `` However , due to the exceptional circumstances in which the FIA gave the team 's drivers an immunity in return for providing evidence , there is no penalty in regard to drivers ' points . '' Should McLaren 's drivers , Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton , win in any of the remaining races of the 2007 season no representatives of McLaren will be allowed on the podium . The WMSC is expected to announce the reasons for its decisions on September 14 . In July the WMSC ruled that McLaren was in breach of Article 151c of the FIA International Sporting Code but recommended that no punitive measures were taken until a hearing of the FIA 's International Court of Appeal on September 13 . However , in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing . The murky story began in June of this year , when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena , Italy . It then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari 's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren 's chief designer Mike Coughlan . Coughlan 's wife , Trudy Coughlan , had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren 's Woking headquarters"], "f1": [0.059880239520958084], "exact_match": [false]},

Erik Prince , CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA , is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing . The committee convened amid an FBI investigation into a September 16 shootout involving Blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians . Following is a transcript of Prince 's opening statement : Chairman -LSB- Henry -RSB- Waxman , -LSB- D-California -RSB- , Congressman -LSB- Thomas -RSB- Davis , -LSB- R-Virginia -RSB- , members of the committee , my name is Eric Prince , and I am the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA . Blackwater 's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America 's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm 's way overseas . Under the direction and oversight of the United States government , Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States . Words alone can not express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions . I am proud to be there to represent them today . After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL , I founded Blackwater in 1997 . I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues . Ten years later , Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day . After 9/11 , when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq , the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas . Blackwater responded immediately . We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country . Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans , many of whom have recent military deployments . No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured . There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men . At the same time , 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates . Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed . The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives . Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families . The areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging . Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq . We 're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis . Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe , including visiting members of Congress . In doing so , more American service members are available to fight the enemy . Blackwater shares the committee 's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations . The company 's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes , treaties and regulations of the United States . Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented . The worldwide personnel protection services contract , which has been provided to this committee , was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance , including the hiring , vetting guidelines , background checks , screening , training standards , rules of force and conduct standards . In Iraq , Blackwater reports to the embassy 's regional security officer , or RSO . All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO . In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls , the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions , as well as any applicable laws and regulations . We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation 's total force . Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions . My understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation , but those results are not"], "f1": [0.006097560975609756], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/564e02cb944ea00c02f9832ab968441b5c67332e.story": {"predictions": ["visitors and employees"], "f1": [0], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/a101c4370d5d4d4e5e7e57d555bb39abd0cdee51.story-2": {"predictions": ["A December rampage that killed hundreds in the Democratic Republic of Congo went largely unreported because of lack of communications in the remote area"], "f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true]}, "./cnn/stories/54daa73840d2f8a75f8831d78a053bf98da0a636.story-1": {"predictions": ["Voltage Coffee"], "f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true]}, "./cnn/stories/5d251418d1cc55e5b50708eca850fd47b858d0b7.story-1": {"predictions": ["Anna Nicole Smith 's longtime partner and attorney Howard K.

'' Columbine , in some ways , represents the broad insecurity triggered by extreme acts of violence . Littleton , Colorado , is as picturesque as the set of a family film . And thanks in part to the 24-hour news cycle , the world witnessed scenes that appeared to be out of a movie : bloodied victims escaping through windows and frightened teens scurrying to safety as law enforcement descended . Film critic Desson Thomson said films such as Gus Van Sant 's `` Elephant '' do not have to reach far into the American psyche to tell a tale of horror in a post-Columbine world . `` Columbine is now a little like the way 9/11 is engrained in our cultural perspective , so that something like ` Elephant ' does n't even have to directly allude to it , '' he said . `` Because we were so immersed in Columbine ... the filmmakers know that the audience has that reference point , so it does n't take much to even poke at that for all of that dimension to come swimming through our consciousness . '' `` Elephant , '' which won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003 , dramatized a normal day at a high school that is about to become the scene of a planned mass slaughter by a pair of friends . Television shows such as `` Law & Order '' and `` Cold Case '' also delved into the lives of fictitious teens on murderous rampages . But music is the one medium that seemed almost primed for an interpretation of the day 's events . Shock rocker Marilyn Manson weathered speculation that his songs may have influenced the pair of young murderers . He addressed the issue in a Rolling Stone magazine article in 1999 . `` When it comes down to who 's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton , Colorado , throw a rock and you 'll hit someone who 's guilty , '' Manson wrote . `` We 're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns , and we 're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them . '' The spotlight on Manson did n't discourage other artists from referencing Columbine in their songs , music videos and lyrics . Genres from rock to rap reflected on the tragedy . Manson himself released an album titled `` Holy Wood -LRB- In the Shadow of the Valley of Death -RRB- '' that contained songs alluding to the massacre . In the single '' The Nobodies , '' Manson appeared to reiterate statements from his first-person piece in Rolling Stone with the lyrics `` Some children died the other day , We fed machines and then we prayed , Puked up and down in morbid faith , You should have seen the ratings that day .
