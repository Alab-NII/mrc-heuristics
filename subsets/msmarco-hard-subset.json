force ( with g from gravitational ) is a measurement of the type of acceleration that causes weight . despite the name , it is incorrect to consider g - force a fundamental force , as g - force ( lower case character ) is a type of acceleration that can be measured with an accelerometer . in physics , a force is an external cause responsible for any change of a physical system . for instance , a person holding a dog by a rope is experiencing the force applied by the rope on his hand , and the cause for its pulling forward is the force exercised by the rope . it is the mass that accelerates by one foot per second squared when a force of one lbf is exerted on it . when the standard gee ( an acceleration of 9.80665 m / s\u00b2 ) is used to define pounds force , the mass in pounds is numerically equal to the weight in pounds force . because momentum is a vector , then force , being its time derivative , is also a vector - it has magnitude and direction . forces can be added together using the parallelogram of force . when two forces act on an object , the resulting force , the resultant , is the vector sum of the original forces . if the mass m is measured in kilograms and the acceleration a is measured in meters per second squared , then the unit of force is kilogram x meter / second squared . this unit is called the newton : 1 n = 1 kg x 1 m / s\u00b2 . the word you are thinking of is joules ( symbolized by j ) , but that 's not what force is measured in . force is measured in newtons ( symbolized by n ) . here are the definitions of the two words : + one joule is the work done , or energy expended , by a force of one newton moving one meter along the direction of the force . + the newton is the unit of force derived in the si system ; it is equal to the amount of force required to give a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of one meter per second squared . best answer : force is normally measured in the si unit of newtons which is equal to 1 kg accelerating"]}, "294435": {"rouge_l": [1.0], "predictions": ["60 representatives"]}, "1008706": {"rouge_l": [0.08047493403693931], "predictions": ["mtdna is tested . everyone can test their autosomal dna to see if they have some percentage of native american ancestry utilizing the family finder test"]}, "532142": {"rouge_l": [0.7858293075684382], "predictions": ["unemployment rate in honolulu , hawaii , is 3.60"]}, "1037794": {"rouge_l": [0.0], "predictions": ["country in south east asia"]}, "1097977": {"rouge_l": [0.10099337748344371], "predictions": ["12 to 24 hours"]}, "594888": {"rouge_l": [0.0], "predictions": ["dolby theatre at hollywood & highland center in hollywood"]}, "1094031": {"rouge_l": [0.0], "predictions": ["salt is an ionic compound that is produced when a cation and an anion from an acid -

dimensional space , some of the bonds may cancel each other out . for example , take cf4.all four of the c - f bonds are polar , but in the molecule as a whole , they are all cancel each other out due to how they are oriented spacially . ch2f2 , though , polar . this is because there are two different kinds of bonds , which are two c - h bonds and two c - f bonds . there is a net polarity to the molecule because of this . an easy way to look at it is if all the atoms connected to the central atom are the same , as in cf4 , then the molecule will not be polar.or example , take cf4 . all four of the c -

an octagon has 8(8\u22123)/2 = 8\u00d75/2 = 20 diagonals . a triangle has 3(3\u22123)/2 = 3\u00d70/2 = 0 diagonals . best answer : a pentagon has 5 diagonals ( a star shape if you draw it ) a hexagon has 9 diagonals . in a shape with n vertices , each vertex can connect to n-3 other ... diagonals of polygons . a polygon 's diagonals are line segments from one corner to another ( but not the edges

. home prices have historically been rising even before the bubble of the 2000s began . there are a number of reasons for this . 1  since historically prices kept going up people would pay more for a house than it was worth since it was an \u201c investment . \u201d hence the housing bubble . 2  inflation has gone up and home prices went up with it . traditionally , a man buying and owning his own house was a major milestone in a man \u2019s life along with marriage and having children . however , just like marriage i would argue that buying a house today is also a bad idea . some men take great pride in owning their own homes and will disagree with me on this point , but i will put forth some logical counterarguments for why i believe this to be true . low interest rates are an illusion . people will try to convince you that buying a house when interest rates are low is a good idea because the interest payments will be lower . this is true , but if interest rates are low then housing prices are high . pro : location , location , location . older homes are often built closer to the center of town , making it easy to walk to local shops , schools and other amenities . if you happen to find an old house out of town , it could still have local shops , schools and other amenities within walking distance . homes with old heating systems or inefficient plumbing can be in such bad shape that they do not comply with modern building codes . it is a good idea to take a careful look at each system in an older home ( heating , wiring , plumbing , air conditioning , etc . ) to make sure they are modern , efficient and safe . yes , you can get lucky renting , but it \u2019s not always easy being in a rental . as for being in a good neighborhood , one of the reasons we liked the neighborhood we picked is because of the good school district . there are rental apartments in the town but there really are n\u2019t many ; it \u2019s mostly homes . the new york times , in their your money section , recently ran an article titled in defense of home ownership . in the article the author , ron lieber , takes to task the notion that now is a horrible time to buy a
