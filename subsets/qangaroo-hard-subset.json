In the first sense, it refers to a particular set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all.\n\nYouth activism is youth engagement in community organizing for social change . Youth activists fight for a better world ! Youth participation in social change focuses more on issue - oriented activism than traditional partisan or electoral politics .

This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., \"Calyptapis\") are known from fossils. Over 250 species of bumblebee are known. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. The brood parasitic or cuckoo bumblebees have sometimes been classified as a subgenus or genus, \"Psithyrus\", but are now usually treated as members of \"Bombus\".\n\nCarpenter bees are species in the genus Xylocopa of the subfamily Xylocopinae. The genus includes some 500 species in 31 subgenera. Members of the related tribe Ceratinini sometimes are called \"small carpenter bees\". The common name \"carpenter bee\" derives from their nesting behavior; nearly all species burrow into hard plant material such as dead wood or bamboo. The main exceptions are species in the subgenus \"Proxylocopa\"; they dig nesting tunnels in suitable soil.\n\nAnts are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\n\nThe flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \"angiosperm\" comes from the Greek composite word (\"angeion\", \"case\" or \"casing\", and \"sperma\", \"seed\") meaning \"enclosed seeds\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.\n\nInsects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \"cut into sections\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.\n\nPollination is the process by which pollen is transferred to the female reproductive organs of a plant, thereby enabling fertilization to take place. Like all living organisms, seed plants have a single major goal: to pass their genetic information on to the next generation. The reproductive unit is the seed, and pollination is an essential step in the production of seeds in all spermatophytes (seed plants).\n\nMexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and Le\u00f3n.\n\nA crop is any cultivated plant, fungus, or alga that is harvested for food, clothing, livestock, fodder, biofuel, medicine, or other uses. In contrast, animals that are raised by humans are called livestock, except those that are kept as pets. Microbes, such as bacteria or viruses, are referred to as cultures. Microbes are not typically grown for food, but are rather used to alter food. For example, bacteria are used to ferment milk to produce yogurt.\n\nThe Holarctic is the name for the biogeographic realm that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world, combining Wallace's Palearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North Africa and all of Eurasia (with the exception of the southern Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent), and the Nearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North America north of Southern Mexico. These regions are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm. The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm. The floristic Boreal Kingdom corresponds to the Holarctic realm.\n\nHoney is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \"Apis\") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.\nHoney gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium \"Clostridium botulinum\", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism.\nPeople who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272\u00a0kj per 100\u00a0g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs.\nHoney use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.\n\nA habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.\n\nStingless bees, sometimes called stingless honey bees or simply meliponines, are a large group of bees (about 500 species), comprising the tribe Meliponini (or subtribe Meliponina according to other authors).

Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters long on the Great Lakes are called oreboats.

A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, \"de jure\" slavery.

Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour, to refer to such situations.

First published in 1826 , it is a reworked version of an earlier short story of the same name published in the Hugo brothers ' magazine Le Conservateur litt\u00e9raire in 1820 . The novel follows a friendship between the enslaved African prince of the title and a French military officer named Leopold D'Auverney during the tumultuous early years of the Haitian Revolution . Hugo later claimed that the story was to have been part of a collaborative work called Contes sous la Tente ( Tales under a Tent ) , and that he had written it in 1818 ( at the age of sixteen ) in two weeks ; the manuscript is however dated April 1819 .

Depending on the context, Manchuria can either refer to a region that falls entirely within the People's Republic of China, or a larger region divided between China and Russia. The region that falls entirely within modern China is now usually referred to as Northeast China in China, although \"Manchuria\" is widely used outside of China to denote the geographical and historical region. This region is the traditional homeland of the Xianbei, Khitan, and Jurchen (later called Manchu) peoples, who built several states historically, although no term for \"Manchuria\" exists in the Manchu language, which originally referred to the area as the \"Three Eastern Provinces\".\n\nChina, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381\u00a0billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\n\nBaekje or Paekche (18 BC  660 AD) was a kingdom located in southwest Korea. It was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, together with Goguryeo and Silla.\n\nThe concept of the Three Kingdoms of Korea refers to the three kingdoms of Baekje (), Silla () and Goguryeo (), which was later known as Goryeo (), from which the name \"Korea\" is derived. The Three Kingdoms period was defined as being from 57 BC to 668 AD (but there existed about 78 tribal states in the southern region of Korean peninsula and relatively big states like Okjeo, Buyeo, and Dongye in its northern part and Manchuria).\n\nThe Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \"Three Kingdoms\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \"Three Kingdoms\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.\n\nGoguryeo (, 37 BCE668 CE) or Goryeo, was one of the ancient Three Kingdoms of Korea, located in the northern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula and the southern and central parts of inner and outer Manchuria. Goguryeo was an active participant in the power struggle for control of the Korean peninsula and was also associated with the foreign affairs of neighboring polities in China and Japan.\n\nKorea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea"]}, "WH_dev_1883": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["romantic comedy"]}, "WH_dev_2180": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Fredericksburg"]}, "WH_dev_267": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["fjords"]}, "WH_dev_1774": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["5 March 1964"]}, "WH_dev_5116": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["record producer"]}, "WH_dev_3904": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Eurasia"]}, "WH_dev_4600": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Hungary"]}, "WH_dev_4171": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Warren Foster"]}, "WH_dev_1232": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Latin Empire"]}, "WH_dev_1839": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Texas"]}, "WH_dev_2301": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Conwy County Borough"]}, "WH_dev_4710": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["supernatural"]}, "WH_dev_1631": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Latin"]}, "WH_dev_1324": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Kannur district"]}, "WH_dev_4805": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["New Jersey"]}, "WH_dev_1234": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["2003"]}, "WH_dev_1476": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["New York State Registry"]}, "WH_dev_3436": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Torrance"]}, "WH_dev_1108": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Turku"]}, "WH_dev_440": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["artist"]}, "WH_dev_1283": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Duchy of Normandy"]}, "WH_dev_2254": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["taxonomy"]}, "WH_dev_1220": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Leeds"]}, "WH_dev_1038": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Gera"]}, "WH_dev_1586": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Philadelphia"]}, "WH_dev_760": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["United States of America"]}, "WH_dev_4031": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Cowlitz County"]}, "WH_dev_3115": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Dresden"]}, "WH_dev_990": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures on November 16, 1990.

Pippen, along with Michael Jordan, played an important role in transforming the Bulls team into a championship team and for popularizing the NBA around the world during the 1990s.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago. The Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded on January 16, 1966. The team plays its home games at the United Center, an arena shared with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Bulls saw their greatest success during the 1990s. They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats.

Voting is conducted by the NBA head coaches; who are not allowed to vote for players on their own team. The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a first team and a second team. The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when Kawhi Leonard, Iman Shumpert, and Brandon Knight tied in votes received. No respect is given to positions. For example, the first team had four forwards, and one guard in 2008, while the first team had four centers (two of which were forward-centers) and one guard in 2015.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks"]}, "WH_dev_3639": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Iran"]}, "WH_dev_4346": {"f1": [0.0273972602739726], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries.

The word \"engineer (\"from the Latin \"ingeniator\"\")\" is derived from the Latin words \"ingeniare\" (\"to contrive, devise\") and \"ingenium\" (\"cleverness\"). The foundation education of an engineer is typically a 4-year bachelor's degree or in some countries, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus 46 years peer-reviewed professional practice culminating in a project report or thesis.

Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders. Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers. According to economic theory, consumption of goods and services is assumed to provide utility (satisfaction) to the consumer or end-user, although businesses also consume goods and services in the course of producing other goods and services.\n\nSocial science"]}, "WH_dev_3028": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus"]}, "WH_dev_3379": {"f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true], "predictions": ["Bloomsbury Group"]}, "WH_dev_2777": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["El Giza"]}, "WH_dev_420": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["1933"]}, "WH_dev_4816": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["British Army"]}, "WH_dev_2619": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Ibadan"]}, "WH_dev_1665": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["J Records"]}, "WH_dev_1244": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["bicycle racer"]}, "WH_dev_3524": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["BBC Two"]}, "WH_dev_3174": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Paramaribo"]}, "WH_dev_4499": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Helsinki"]}, "WH_dev_3992": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Bucharest"]}, "WH_dev_1256": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Aegean Sea"]}, "WH_dev_4783": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Avex Trax"]}, "WH_dev_3423": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["8 June 1955"]}, "WH_dev_693": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["13 November 1930"]}, "WH_dev_4552": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Lee County"]}, "WH_dev_3679": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["21 February 1898"]}, "WH_dev_459": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["United Kingdom"]}, "WH_dev_3506": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["live album"]}, "WH_dev_2725": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["The Good Times"]}, "WH_dev_3433": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Netherlands"]}, "WH_dev_1406": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["1220"]}, "WH_dev_3149": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["television thriller"]}, "WH_dev_3382": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["film actor"]}, "WH_dev_673": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Peace"]}, "WH_dev_373": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["homosexuality of Sebastian Flyte"]}, "WH_dev_4602": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Mostar"]}, "WH_dev_4937": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Henry County"]}, "WH_dev_2347": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Burkina Faso"]}, "WH_dev_1843": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["WisconsinMadison"]}, "WH_dev_3237": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Laurens City"]}, "WH_dev_2056": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["piano"]}, "WH_dev_1466": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["fighting crime"]}, "WH_dev_1893": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Wayne County"]}, "WH_dev_3064": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Accipitridae"]}, "WH_dev_3792": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["superhero film"]}, "WH_dev_4885": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Pike County"]}, "WH_dev_82": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Missouri"]}, "WH_dev_2365": {"f1": [0.00684931506849315], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["software work.\n\nComputer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.\n\nIn mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 (zero) and 1 (one). The base-2 system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices. Each digit is referred to as a bit.\n\nMathematics (from Greek  \"m\u00e1thma\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.\n\nPositional notation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the \"ones place\", \"tens place\", \"hundreds place\"). This greatly simplified arithmetic, leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.\n\nA programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.\n\nEngineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.\n\nInformation is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.\n\nIn computing , a physical address ( also real address , or binary address ) , is a memory address that is represented in the form of a binary number on the address bus circuitry in order to enable the data bus to access a particular storage cell of main memory , or a register of memory mapped I / O device .\n\nA computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \"program\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.\n\nComputer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software.

With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61\u00a0million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.\n\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \"Union of the Crowns\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.\n\nWales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.\n\nEngland is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\n\nThe Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.\n\nA country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \"Old World\" from the \"New World\".\n\nThe Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th centurywhen it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdomsuntil 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\nThe charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \"habeas corpus\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.\nThe political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787"]}, "WH_dev_3716": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Lucas County"]}, "WH_dev_1849": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Cadet Organizations Administration"]}, "WH_dev_3114": {"f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true], "predictions": ["Joseph Kane"]}, "WH_dev_2136": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["baseball venue"]}, "WH_dev_227": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["seminary, theological seminary, theological college or divinity school is an educational institution for educating students (sometimes called \"seminarians\") in theology, generally to prepare them for ordination as clergy, academia, or ministry.

Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit autobiographies, memoirs, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either edit or rewrite their scripts to improve them.\n\nAlexandre Dumas (, born Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie ; 24 July 1802\u00a0 5 December 1870), also known as Alexandre Dumas, \"p\u00e8re\", was a French writer. His works have been translated into nearly 100 languages, and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high adventure were originally published as serials, including \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", \"The Three Musketeers\", \"Twenty Years After\", and \"\". His novels have been adapted since the early twentieth century for nearly 200 films. Dumas' last novel, \"The Knight of Sainte-Hermine,\" unfinished at his death, was completed by a scholar and published in 2005, becoming a bestseller. It was published in English in 2008 as \"The Last Cavalier.\"\n\nAuguste Maquet ( French : ( oyst mak ) ; 13 September 1813 , Paris -- 8 January 1888 ) was a French author , best known as the chief collaborator of French novelist"]}, "WH_dev_736": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Argentina"]}, "WH_dev_2233": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Half Man Half Biscuit"]}, "WH_dev_3397": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Yavapai County"]}, "WH_dev_4809": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["1993"]}, "WH_dev_1890": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["cardiologists"]}, "WH_dev_4365": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Werner Herzog"]}, "WH_dev_4571": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["record producer"]}, "WH_dev_4541": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Rochdale"]}, "WH_dev_4585": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Raleigh"]}, "WH_dev_4620": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Koronadal"]}, "WH_dev_1328": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Leipzig"]}, "WH_dev_4309": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Douglas"]}, "WH_dev_1021": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck"]}, "WH_dev_2720": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["Iran"]}, "WH_dev_1842": {"f1": [0], "exact_match": [false], "predictions": ["diplomatic mission is a group of people from one state or an international inter-governmental organisation ( such as the United Nations ) present in another state to represent the sending state / organisation officially in the receiving state .

As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated , it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries . There are thus resident and non-resident embassies .\n\nExtraterritoriality is the state of being exempted from the jurisdiction of local law, usually as the result of diplomatic negotiations. Historically, this applied to individuals. Extraterritoriality can also be applied to physical places, such as foreign embassies, military bases of foreign countries, or offices of the United Nations. The three most common cases recognized today internationally relate to the persons and belongings of foreign heads of state, the persons and belongings of ambassadors and other diplomats, and ships in foreign waters.\n\nWorld War\u00a0II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War\u00a0II the deadliest conflict in human history.\n\nThe League of Nations (abbreviated as LN in English, \"La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Nations\" abbreviated as SDN or SdN in French) was an intergovernmental organisation founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. It was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace.

Although exact definitions may vary, types of annuals include: Calendars and almanacs, directories, yearbooks, annual reports, proceedings and transactions, and literary annuals. A weekly or monthly publication may produce an \"Annual\" featuring similar materials to the regular publication. Some encyclopedias have published annual supplements that essentially summarize the news of the past year, similar to some newspaper yearbooks.\n\nA review article is an article that summarizes the current state of understanding on a topic. A review article surveys and summarizes previously published studies, rather than reporting new facts or analysis. Review articles are sometimes also called survey articles or, in news publishing, overview articles. Academic publications that specialize in review articles are known as review journals.\n\nThe impact factor ( IF ) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal . It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field , with journals with higher impact factors deemed to be more important than those with lower ones . The impact factor was devised by Eugene Garfield , the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information . Impact factors are calculated yearly starting from 1975 for those journals that are indexed in the Journal Citation Reports .\n\nEugene Garfield (born September 16, 1925) is an American linguist and businessman, one of the founders of bibliometrics and scientometrics.\n\nJournal Citation Reports (JCR) is an annual publication by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters). It has been integrated with the Web of Science and is accessed from the Web of Science-Core Collections. It provides information about academic journals in the sciences and social sciences, including impact factors. The \"JCR\" was originally published as a part of \"Science Citation Index\". Currently, the \"JCR\", as a distinct service, is based on citations compiled from the \"Science Citation Index Expanded\" and the \"Social Science Citation Index\".\n\nThomson Reuters Corporation is a multinational mass media and information firm with operational headquarters at 3 Times Square in Manhattan, New York City. The firm was founded in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where its legal domicile offices are located at 333 Bay Street in Downtown Toronto. Thomson Reuters shares maintain a dual listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: TRI) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: TRI).\n\nThe Science Citation Index (SCI) is a citation index originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and created by Eugene Garfield. It was officially launched in 1964. It is now owned by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters). The larger version (Science Citation Index Expanded) covers more than 8,500 notable and significant journals, across 150 disciplines, from 1900 to the present. These are alternatively described as the world's leading journals of science and technology, because of a rigorous selection process.\n\nWeb of Science (previously known as Web of Knowledge) is an online subscription-based scientific citation indexing service originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), now maintained by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters), that provides a comprehensive citation search. It gives access to multiple databases that reference cross-disciplinary research, which allows for in-depth exploration of specialized sub-fields within an academic or scientific discipline.\n\nScientometrics is the study of measuring and analysing science, technology and innovation. Major research issues include the measurement of impact, reference sets of articles to investigate the impact of journals and institutes, understanding of scientific citations, mapping scientific fields and the production of indicators for use in policy and management contexts. In practice there is a significant overlap between scientometrics and other scientific fields such as bibliometrics, information systems, information science and science of science policy.\n\nReference is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to \"refer to\" the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the \"referent\" of the first object.\n\nAn academic or scholarly journal is a periodical publication in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published. Academic journals serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny and discussion of research. They are usually peer-reviewed or refereed. Content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, and book reviews.

The term \"Hebrew\" was not used for the language in the Bible, which was referred to as Canaanite or Judahite, but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century\u00a0BCE, and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in the siege of Jerusalem (AD 70).\n\nBiblical Aramaic is the form of Aramaic that is used in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few other places in the Hebrew Bible.

The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.\n\nJesus (; c. 4\u00a0BC  c.

Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. The heart is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.\nIn humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the \"right heart\" and their left counterparts as the \"left heart\". Fish in contrast have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.\nThe heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulationwhere the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths.

(known professionally as Columbia Pictures and Columbia, and formerly CBC Film Sales Corporation) is an American film studio, production company and film distributor that is a member of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, a division of Sony Entertainment's Sony Pictures subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony. The studio was founded in 1918 as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn Film Sales by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and Jack's best friend Joe Brandt, released its first feature film in August 1922. It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924, and went public two years later. Its name is derived from \"Columbia\", a national personification of the United States, which is used as the studio's logo. In its early years, it was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio.\n\nWilliam Holden (born William Franklin Beedle, Jr.; April 17, 1918\u00a0 November 12, 1981) was an American actor who was one of the biggest box office draws of the 1950s through the 1970s. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1953 for his role in \"Stalag 17\", and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor for his role in the 1973 television film \"The Blue Knight\".\n\nThe Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group (commonly known as the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group and formerly known as the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group until 2013 and abbreviated as SPMPG) is a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment to manage its motion picture operations.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.\n\nMS-DOS (; acronym for \"Microsoft Disk Operating System\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.\n\nThe user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.\n\nThe concept of video games as a form of art is a controversial topic within the entertainment industry.

There are usually three upper hepatic veins draining from the left, middle, and right parts of the liver. These are larger than the group of lower hepatic veins that can number from six to twenty. All of the hepatic veins drain into the inferior vena cava.\n\nThe pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland.\n\nThe hepatic artery proper ( also proper hepatic artery ) , arises from the common hepatic artery and runs alongside the portal vein and the common bile duct to form the portal triad . A branch of the common hepatic artery -- the gastroduodenal artery gives off the small supraduodenal artery to the duodenal bulb . Then the right gastric artery comes off and runs to the left along the lesser curvature of the stomach to meet the left gastric artery , which is a branch of the celiac trunk . It subsequently bifurcates into the right and left hepatic arteries . Of note , the right and left hepatic arteries may demonstrate variant anatomy . A misplaced right hepatic artery may arise from the superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) and a misplaced left hepatic artery may arise from the left gastric artery . The cystic artery generally comes off of the right hepatic artery .\n\nThe heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. The heart is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.\nIn humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the \"right heart\" and their left counterparts as the \"left heart\". Fish in contrast have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.\nThe heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulationwhere the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.\n\nThe pylorus (or ), or pyloric part, connects the stomach to the duodenum.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.\n\nGary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901  May 13, 1961) was an American film actor known for his natural, authentic, and understated acting style and screen performances.

The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \"Soviet Army\", until its dissolution in December 1991.\n\nRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR or RSFSR; ), commonly known as , was a sovereign state in 191722 and 1991-93, the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic of the Soviet Union in 192291 and a sovereign part of the Soviet Union with its own legislation in 199091.

The capital of the Russian SFSR was Moscow and the other major urban centers included Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\n\nA marksman (also known as a sharpshooter) is a person who is skilled in precision shooting, using projectile weapons, usually with a rifle but most commonly with a designated marksman rifle or a special application rifle, to shoot at long range targets. In popular and historical usage, \"sharpshooter\" and \"marksman\" are considered synonyms. Within the shooting sports and military usages today, however, sharpshooter and marksman refer to distinctly different levels of skill, which are never conflated.

After his uncle Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914, Charles I reigned from 1916 until 1918 when he \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. He spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy until his death in 1922. Following his beatification by the Catholic Church in 2004, he has become commonly known as Blessed Charles of Austria.\n\n\"K.u.k. Feldmarschall\" Franz Xaver Joseph Conrad Graf von H\u00f6tzendorf (11 November 1852  25 August 1925), sometimes anglicised as Hoetzendorf, was an Austrian Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff of the armed forces of the Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy 19061917. He was the Empire's leading military advisor during the 1914 July Crisis that led to the outbreak of World War\u00a0I. He argued persuasively for preventive war against Serbia, saying it was needed to hold together his polyglot empire on the verge of breaking down. He later decided that Austria acted too late, and its failure to fight earlier was a fatal mistake. He admitted his army was not ready for war, and therefore emphasized the political necessity. He failed to realize that Germany would force him to put his chief assets on the Russian front, rather than Serbia. Conrad was reluctant to fight Russia, and when Italy entered the war in 1915, he shifted his attention away from Russia toward Italy, the Balkans and the Adriatic. From early 1915 his forces were increasingly dependent on German support and command. Without German support the Austrian army was a spent force.\nIn 1917, Charles I of Austria dismissed him as Chief of Staff; he commanded an army group on the Italian front until he retired in 1918.\nTitled \"Freiherr\" (usually translated as Baron) since 1910; from 1918 until April 1919 raised to the title of \"Graf\", usually translated as Count; from April 1919 Conrad's official name was Franz Conrad-H\u00f6tzendorf, since the Republic of Austria abolished nobility for its citizens by law.\n\nJapanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture, ink painting and calligraphy on silk and paper, \"ukiyo-e\" paintings and woodblock prints, kirigami, origami, and more recently mangamodern Japanese cartooning and comicsalong with a myriad of other types of works of art. It has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present.\nJapan has been subject to sudden invasions of new and strange ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [Buddhism]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the nin War (14671477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the Tokugawa shogunate, organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.\nPainting is the preferred artistic expression in Japan, practiced by amateurs and professionals alike. Until modern times, the Japanese wrote with a brush rather than a pen, and their familiarity with brush techniques has made them particularly sensitive to the values and aesthetics of painting. With the rise of popular culture in the Edo period, a style of woodblock prints became a major form and its techniques were fine tuned to produce colorful prints. The Japanese, in this period, found sculpture a much less sympathetic medium for artistic expression; most Japanese sculpture is associated with religion, and the medium's use declined with the lessening importance of traditional Buddhism.\nJapanese ceramics are among the finest in the world and include the earliest known artifacts of their culture. In architecture, Japanese preferences for natural materials and an interaction of interior and exterior space are clearly expressed.\n\nThe July Crisis was a diplomatic crisis among the major powers of Europe in the summer of 1914 that led to World War I.
