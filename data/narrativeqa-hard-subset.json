with cerebral palsy . customs agent dave kujan flies in from new york city to interrogate verbal , who describes in flashback the events that led him and four other criminals - keaton , michael mcmanus , fred fenster and todd hockney - onto the ship . verbal explains that , six weeks earlier in new york , he and the other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped - up hijacking charge , and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police . led by keaton , a former corrupt policeman , they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy . they then went to california to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named redfoot . redfoot turned them on to another jewel heist , but the quarry turned out to be heroin , and the five had to shoot their way out . soon after , a lawyer named kobayashi contacted them and told them that keyser s\u00f6ze , a turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen ( including hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in new york ) , had offered them a job : invade a ship manned by a gang of argentinian drug dealers with whom s\u00f6ze was competing and destroy the $ 91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting . when kujan learns of s\u00f6ze from fbi agent jack baer , he questions verbal about him . verbal tells kujan an underworld legend about s\u00f6ze : that he had murdered his own family after they had been attacked by a gang of hungarian criminals , and then massacred the hungarians and everyone they held dear . he then went underground , never to be seen again , and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working . he became a fearsome urban legend , a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night . verbal goes on to explain that , after fenster had bailed on the group , kobayashi gave them a location at which to find their compatriot s dead body . they tried to kill kobayashi , but he strong - armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones . they staked out the ship and killed several argentinian and hungarian gangsters , but found no drugs on board . mcmanus , hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person , who also killed keaton and set the ship on fire as verbal looked on . verbal concludes his story , but kujan does not believe it . he insists that keaton must be s\u00f6ze , as one of the murder victims on the boat was arturo marquez , a drug dealer who escaped prosecution by claiming he could identify s\u00f6ze \u2014 and who was represented by edie finneran , keaton s lawyer and girlfriend . kujan claims that the argentinians were selling marquez to s\u00f6ze s hungarian rivals and keaton used the heist as a distraction to let him kill marquez . kujan also informs verbal that finneran has been murdered . verbal says that the entire plan was keaton s idea , but refuses to testify in court . verbal s bond is posted and he is released . moments later , kujan realizes that verbal s entire story was a lie , pieced together from details on a crowded bulletin board in his office . meanwhile , verbal walks outside , gradually dropping his limp and flexing his supposedly withered hand . as kujan runs after verbal , a fax comes in from california : a police sketch artist s

cover , but he does not understand the danger . a nuclear explosion causes a sudden volcanic eruption around him . george continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens , trapping him inside . he travels far into the future until the topography changes . hundreds of thousands of years later , the rock erodes away to reveal that london is now gone , and has been replaced by a lush , green and unspoilt landscape . george stops in ad 802,701 near the base of a towering sphinx . he goes exploring and finds a group of delicate young men and women wearing simple clothing gathered at a stream . one woman , carried off by the current , screams for help but none of her companions show any concern . george rescues her and is surprised when , revived , she walks away without a word ; later , she seeks him out , giving him a flower . she says her name is weena ( yvette mimieux ) and tells george her people are called the eloi . he soon learns the eloi do not operate machines , work , read , and know virtually nothing of history ; they do not even understand fire . george decides to leave but discovers his machine has been dragged into the sphinx . weena tells him morlocks , who only come out at night , have moved it . a morlock jumps out from behind bushes and tries to drag her away , but the creature s light - sensitive eyes are blinded by george s fire torch ; he easily rescues her . the next day , weena shows george domed , well - like structures that dot the landscape ; they are air shafts that double as access to the morlock underworld . she takes him to an ancient museum where talking rings tell of a centuries - long nuclear war in the distant past . a reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape ; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements , while some decided to return to the surface . george realises this marked the beginning of speciation for the morlocks and the eloi . he starts to climb down a shaft but turns back when sirens blare from atop the sphinx . he emerges to find weena gone and crowds of eloi in a trance - like state , entering open doors at its base . the sirens stop and the doors close , trapping weena inside . george enters the morlocks ' subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the eloi are the free range livestock for the cannibalistic morlocks . after finding weena , he begins fighting the creatures . his efforts inspire other eloi , who begin to defend themselves . george sets a fire and urges the eloi to clamber out of the caverns to the surface , where he directs them to gather dry tree branches and drop them down the shafts . smoke billows out of the shafts , and the subterranean cavern later collapses . the next morning , george

exhausted , george arrives and begins to describe the strange experiences he has had since the group last met . at their earlier dinner , on december 31 , 1899 , george describes time as the fourth dimension to david filby ( alan young ) , dr. philip hillyer ( sebastian cabot ) , anthony bridewell ( tom helmore ) , and walter kemp ( whit bissell ) . he shows them a small model of his time machine and asks a guest to press a tiny lever . the device disappears , validating his claim , but his friends remain unconvinced ; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal . george bids his guests a good evening , then heads downstairs where his full - size time machine awaits . he presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future . he meets filby s son , james , who tells him of filby s death in the great war . saddened , he resumes his journey , stopping in 1940 during the blitz , finding himself in the midst of a new war ; george resumes his journey and stops in 1966 , finding his neighbourhood now part of a futuristic metropolis . people are hurrying into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens . an elderly james filby urges george to immediately take cover , but he does not understand the danger . a nuclear explosion causes a sudden volcanic eruption around him . george continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens , trapping him inside . he travels far into the future until the topography changes . hundreds of thousands of years later , the rock erodes away to reveal that london is now gone , and has been replaced by a lush , green and unspoilt landscape . george stops in ad 802,701 near the base of a towering sphinx . he goes exploring and finds a group of delicate young men and women wearing simple clothing gathered at a stream . one woman , carried off by the current , screams for help but none of her companions show any concern . george rescues her and is surprised when , revived , she walks away without a word ; later , she seeks him out , giving him a flower . she says her name is weena ( yvette mimieux ) and tells george her people are called the eloi . he soon learns the eloi do not operate machines , work , read , and know virtually nothing of history ; they do not even understand fire . george decides to leave but discovers his machine has been dragged into the sphinx . weena tells him morlocks , who only come out at night , have moved it . a morlock jumps out from behind bushes and tries to drag her away , but the creature s light - sensitive eyes are blinded by george s fire torch ; he easily rescues her . the next day , weena shows george domed , well - like structures that dot the landscape ; they are air shafts that double as access to the morlock underworld . she takes him to an ancient museum where talking rings tell of a centuries - long nuclear war in the distant past . a reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape ; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements , while some decided to return to the surface . george realises this marked the beginning of speciation for the morlocks and the eloi . he starts to climb down a shaft but turns back when sirens blare from atop the sphinx . he emerges to find weena gone and crowds of eloi in a trance - like state , entering open doors at its base . the sirens stop and the doors close , trapping weena inside . george enters the morlocks ' subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the eloi are the free range livestock for the cannibalistic morlocks . after finding weena , he begins fighting the creatures . his efforts inspire other eloi , who begin to defend themselves . george sets a fire and urges the eloi to clamber out of the caverns to the surface , where he directs them to gather dry tree branches and drop them down the shafts . smoke billows out of the shafts , and the subterranean cavern later collapses . the next morning , george finds the sphinx in charred ruins and its doors open . his time machine sits just inside , a trap set by the morlocks . he enters , the doors close , and he is attacked in the dark . george sends his time machine hurtling into the past , returning to 1900 . it comes to rest on the lawn outside his house , where his story ends . george s friends are again skeptical . he produces weena s flower and filby , an amateur botanist , says the species is completely unknown in the 19th century . george bids his guests a good evening . filby steps out but returns to find

criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped - up hijacking charge , and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police . led by keaton , a former corrupt policeman , they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy . they then went to california to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named redfoot . redfoot turned them on to another jewel heist ,

a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen ( including hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in new york ) , had offered them a job : invade a ship manned by a gang of argentinian drug dealers with whom s\u00f6ze was competing and destroy the $ 91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting . when kujan learns of s\u00f6ze from fbi agent

, and then massacred the hungarians and everyone they held dear . he then went underground , never to be seen again , and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working . he became a fearsome urban legend , a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night . verbal goes on to explain that , after fenster had bailed on the group , kobayashi gave them a location at which to find their compatriot s dead body . they tried to kill kobayashi , but he strong - armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones . they staked out the ship and killed several argentinian and hungarian gangsters , but found no drugs on board . mcmanus , hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person , who also killed keaton and

an accessory before the fact simply because he knows about the proposed burglary . at a nearby bar , ricky roma ( pacino ) , the office s top closer , delivers a long , disjointed but compelling monologue to a meek , middle - aged man named james lingk ( pryce ) . roma does not broach the subject of a glengarry farms real estate deal until he has completely won lingk over with his speech . framing it as an opportunity rather than a purchase , roma plays upon lingk s feelings of insecurity . the film then skips to the next day when the salesmen come into the office to find that there has been a burglary and the glengarry leads have been stolen . williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private . after his interrogation , moss leaves in disgust , only after having one last shouting match with roma . during the cycle of interrogations , lingk arrives to tell roma that his wife has told him to cancel the deal . scrambling to salvage the deal , roma tries to deceive lingk by telling him that the check he wrote the night before has yet to be cashed , and that accordingly he has time to reason with his wife and reconsider . levene abets roma by pretending to be a wealthy investor who just happens to be on his way to the airport . williamson , unaware of roma and levene s stalling tactic , lies to lingk , claiming that he already deposited his check in the bank . upset , lingk rushes out of the office , and roma berates williamson for what he has done . roma then enters williamson s office to take his turn being interrogated by the police . levene , proud of a massive sale he made that morning , takes the opportunity to mock williamson in private . in his zeal to get back at williamson , levene accidentally reveals that he knows williamson lied to roma minutes earlier about depositing lingk s check and had left the check on his desk and had not made the bank run the previous night \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something only a man who broke into the office
