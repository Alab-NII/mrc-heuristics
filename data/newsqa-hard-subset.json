General Edwin Donayre , right , meets with Peruvian President Alan Garcia in Lima , Peru , last year . Chilean President Michelle Bachelet met Monday morning with her domestic advisers to discuss the matter after the Peruvian general appeared unrepentant over the weekend , the Chilean government reported on its Web site . Peruvian President Alan Garc\u00eda had called Bachelet last week to say that the statements by Gen. Edwin Donayre are not the official policy of Peru . Bachelet said at the time she was satisfied with Garc\u00eda 's explanation and it was `` up to the government of Peru to take measures . '' Donayre made the remarks in 2006 or 2007 at a party at a friend 's house , said CNN affiliate station TVN in Santiago , Chile . The video was downloaded to YouTube in February and surfaced a week ago to wider attention . `` We are not going to let Chileans pass by , '' Donayre says in the amateur-quality video as he offers a toast . `` Chilean who enters will not leave . Or will leave in a coffin . And if there are n't sufficient coffins , there will be plastic bags . '' Tensions rose over the weekend when Donayre , who is scheduled to retire Friday , was widely quoted in Peru and Chile as saying that he will not be forced to resign early due to external pressure . `` I was named commander general under a presidential mandate and I can only be relieved under such an order . Not by necessity nor under pressure from another government , '' Donayre said , acording to the Peruvian Andina news agency . Further heightening tensions , Donayre was quoted as saying that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they want at private functions . `` I want to express and specify that it was not a speech nor a public act , '' Andina quotes the general as saying . `` The situation in which what happened at a private gathering was spread worries me . '' In the video , Donayre is surrounded by other uniformed army officials as well as people in civilian dress . It is not clear from the video in what context the general was making his comments . Nor was it clear in what forum Donayre made his comments over the weekend . After Bachelet 's meeting with top aides Monday , government spokesman Francisco Vidal declined to say whether Chile 's ambassador to Peru would be recalled in light of Donayre 's weekend statements . `` General Donayre 's declarations in the past 24 to 48 hours only convince us that we are right and that our government 's posture is reasonable , '' Vidal said on the Chilean government Web site . In Peru , meanwhile , a member of Congress , Gustavo Espinoza , is under investigation , suspected of sending Donayre 's videotaped comment to Chilean press and politicians . A political opponent said Espinoza has an `` unpatriotic attitude , '' the Andina news agency said . `` I would not have expected this conduct from any Peruvian , much less a member of Congress , '' said Aurelio Pastor . Espinoza is already serving a 120-day suspension for leaking a private conversation with another member of Congress , Andina said . Peruvian Defense Minister \u00c1ntero Flores-Ar\u00e1oz told reporters Saturday that relations between the two nations will be repaired , calling the Donayre incident `` a bump in the road . '' Flores-Ar\u00e1oz also said that Donayre 's remarks about Chileans used `` improper terms '' that are not shared by the Peruvian people , Andina said . Peruvian Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Garc\u00eda Belaunde made similar assertions last week . Peru has not taken any measures against the general . His retirement Friday is required by law at the end of his two-year appointment as the army 's top chief . Donayre has been the subject of an investigation in recent weeks concerning the use of 80,000 gallons of fuel under his control as commander of the southern military region in 2006 . Chile and Peru have a long history of animosity , having fought in the War of the Pacific from 1879 to 1883 . Hard feelings linger to this day . More recently , the two nations nearly came to war in 1975 when left-wing Peruvian leader Juan Velasco , who was backed by Cuba , wanted to invade Chile , which was led by right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet . The invasion was called off and Velasco was deposed in a coup a short while later . Tensions rose again when Peru discovered a Chilean spy mission , but war was averted .

On screen the response on a check list was : that each item was `` not done . '' Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous . Make no mistake , a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president . See how ` SNL ' has portrayed presidents '' President Gerald Ford , a gifted athlete , could never overcome the image of a bumbling , clumsy man who banged his head constantly after the hilarious portrayal of him by Chevy Chase . The senior Bush , George H.W. , was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey , and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy , inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions . But the real question being debated on cable TV because of the `` SNL '' parody is this : `` Has the media 's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended ? '' I ca n't answer that . I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era . Sooner or later , all honeymoons for presidents come to an end . This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story , in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers . In the few months President Obama has been in office , the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media , too : `` Is he as good as we all hoped ? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him ? Can he get the job done ? Could anyone ? '' Democrats will add pensively to the words : `` Not Done '' from the `` SNL '' skit , `` Not yet . '' Republicans would add assertively : `` Not ever ! '' Democrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the `` Camelot II '' ; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes . Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson . Republicans have no hope left about Obama .

The British landmark has lived through war , bad weather and disasters . Big Ben 's distinctive bongs have been a part of the London scene for 150 years . Big Ben is the 14-ton bell inside the world 's largest four-faced chiming clock , although most people use the name to describe the tower that houses it . The clock is perched on a 96-meter -LRB- 310-foot -RRB- elegant tower at the Westminster Bridge end of the Palace of Westminster . The Victorian masterpiece , which provides distinctive chimes known as bongs , was voted Britain 's favorite monument in 2008 . It has been featured in films such as `` 101 Dalmatians '' and `` Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix . '' Big Ben has been disrupted a few times over the years for various reasons , including weather and breakages . Its bongs went silent for about two months in August 2007 to allow a crew to repair its mechanism system . During that time , the rest of the clock was running on an electric system . It was fully restarted again October 1 . The clock pays tribute to Britain 's royal history : It has a Latin inscription of the phrase : `` O Lord , save our Queen Victoria the First . '' The ornate masterpiece has some quirky features . The hour hand , which weighs 300 kilograms -LRB- 661 pounds -RRB- , is made of gun metal while the minute hands are made of copper sheet . The minute hands would not work when they were first made of cast iron because they were too heavy . The clock started working on May 31 , 1859 , after the lighter copper hands were installed . The origins of the landmark 's name are obscure . Some say it was named after the 1850s heavyweight boxer Ben Caunt while others suggest it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall"], "f1": [0.14], "exact_match": [false]},

Her first two trips as secretary of state have been packed with events promoting the importance of women 's rights . `` These personal experiences have informed my work , and I will continue to fight for human rights as secretary of state in traditional and especially nontraditional ways and venues , '' Clinton told the audience . You `` ca n't solve problems of financial crisis , climate change , disease and poverty if half of the population is left behind , '' Clinton said . The rights of women will `` always be central to our foreign policy . '' In a commentary published Monday in honor of International Women 's Day , Clinton warned that `` women still comprise the majority of the world 's poor , unfed and unschooled . '' `` Global problems are too big and too complex to be solved without the full participation of women , '' she wrote in the article , which ran in more than 50 newspapers around the world . `` Strengthening women 's rights is not only a continuing moral obligation -- it is also a necessity as we face a global economic crisis , the spread of terrorism and nuclear weapons , regional conflicts that threaten families and communities , and climate change and the dangers it presents to the world 's health and security . '' Ambiga Sreenevasan , a Malaysian lawyer who won an award Wednesday for her work on behalf of justice for women , called Clinton `` a woman of courage who has encouraged woman around the world . '' Clinton 's speech declaring that women 's rights are human rights , Sreenevasan said , has `` resonated with a lot of us here . '' Clinton also heaped praise on the current first lady , saying that in a very short time , Michelle Obama `` through her grace and her wisdom -LSB- has -RSB- become an inspiration to women and girls , not only in the United States , but around the world . '' Obama spoke about the importance of proper health care , education and justice for women in ensuring strong families and communities . `` The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is the presence of women who are valued , where relationships among women and between women and men are based upon mutual respect , '' Obama said . Obama said the work done by the honorees has not just changed their own circumstances , but by inspiring hope and motivating others to act , that work also has changed women 's lives around the world . `` This is how real change occurs , one determined woman at a time . And change is coming , '' she said . `` The women we honor today teach us three very important lessons . One , that as women , we must stand up for ourselves . The second , as women we must stand up for each other . And finally , as women we must stand up for justice for all . '' On Wednesday , President Obama created a White House Council on Women and Girls , charged with devising a coordinated federal response to various challenges faced by American women . The council , which will be led by senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett and which will include most members of the president 's Cabinet , will be charged with ensuring that all governmental agencies take the needs of women into account . The president said the council will also help ensure a more coordinated federal response on a range of issues , including equal pay , family leave and child care . He also nominated Melanne Verveer , Clinton 's chief of staff when she was first lady , as ambassador-at-large for global women 's issues . In addition to Sreenevasan , the Women of Courage honorees make up an impressive list of advocates on behalf of women under difficult and often dangerous circumstances .

Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future . The 21-year-old , who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation , said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal . He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day , he said Sunday . `` It might 've been lesser time , but then again , I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home , '' Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. `` I would n't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister . You know , when you 're a sex offender you ca n't be around kids . Basically , I ca n't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ? '' he asked . In 2005 , a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year 's Eve party . Wilson was 17 at the time of the party . Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal '' The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation . According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker , prosecutors in Douglas County , Georgia , offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record . Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence . The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted , making such sexual encounters misdemeanors . However , the Legislature did not make the law retroactive , so it had no effect on Wilson 's sentence . Now 21 , Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man 's sentence `` constitutes cruel and unusual punishment . '' Wilson said Sunday he feels no `` negative energy '' toward District Attorney David McDade , who fought efforts to have Wilson 's sentence reduced . Instead , Wilson said , he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college"], "f1": [0], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/6a4c73837aa806f1a9af4423c2add45ac2b4ced4.story-6": {"predictions": ["Thursday"], "f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true]}, "./cnn/stories/580053e9e214da1f8e9854f0c6310ecd55288542.story-6": {"predictions": ["save energy , the actress uses the laundry line she got as a birthday present"], "f1": [0.3076923076923077], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/6229e71abd22f39aa95a06a17eda00da4a420edd.story-2": {"predictions": ["traded in their homes for smaller digs"], "f1": [0.5384615384615384], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/90cfb6df2649ef29eb3338fb9d86c86b21a3b23d.story-2": {"predictions": ["carrying a bag in a great color is a fun and inexpensive way to update your look"], "f1": [0.5714285714285715], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/05c016a986f4ed9a792b83ee65fdb997630cf44c.story-1": {"predictions": ["FDA advisory panel"], "f1": [0], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/8a19d95198207046dca6f93bb56932891f96096f.story-9": {"predictions": ["Donna Brazile"], "f1": [0], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/822adbee10be18ad24d319bb6980478c5c0bfeea.story-3": {"predictions": ["Colorado 's 2nd Congressional District"], "f1": [0.22222222222222224], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/533290e4208d6687168882aedc9b6a225e9e31b0.story-4": {"predictions": ["he felt helpless as he stood outside his house and watched the dirty brown water creep up his lawn and approach his front door"], "f1": [0.16], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/2d047b05a2f34812c5686a5f890bd506b44854d2.story-3": {"predictions": ["lose that in minutes"], "f1": [0.08888888888888888], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/a23b9e4ef5a577e3ec435c0801b8526bd4c33657.story-1": {"predictions": ["Mazumdar Shaw with Shah Rukh Khan"], "f1": [0], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/274d50831c42e91abeaeb5f48e9c1a3854e33438.story-4": {"predictions": ["Amnesty International"], "f1": [1.0], "exact_match": [true]}, "./cnn/stories/e474fd102692c1951f2caac452e2f3418a80860b.story-3": {"predictions": ["ended his more than 20-year exile"], "f1": [0], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/7bdcea5310f665ee6ee9793ab0bcb046b2aef13e.story-6": {"predictions": ["Bandar"], "f1": [0.4], "exact_match": [false]}, "./cnn/stories/81976e59f94c2fff12dc78eee8d90723aaed4898.story-7": {"predictions": ["Sen.

We did the one-hour special to show everyone . I always pictured like the little old lady that was sitting at home who was praying for us , rooting for us and needing to know what happened to those babies that were born . So we did it for that reason as well as to collect the memories for ourselves . King : Why did you agree to do a regular reality show ? You could have said that 's the special , here 's my life , goodbye . Gosselin : I could have . At that point , the one-hour special was a very good experience . The network , TLC , we were on Discovery Health at that time . Now , TLC is wonderful , supportive , and it was a great experience for us . So we , you know , really moved forward because of that reason . It was healthy and safe and fun . King : Do the kids talk to you about divorce ? Gosselin : They do . And as any child , you know , when their parents are divorcing , the goal is peace and we 've achieved that numerous times . The Fourth of July we spent together as a family . My goal is , no matter what the circumstance , no matter what place , you know , one of us is in , my goal is really peace and the best that it can be for the kids . King : Do they get counseling ? Gosselin : We have not started that process , but I feel like it is a very normal thing to do . And absolutely , when the time is right . King : Jon is quoted in the new `` Us Weekly '' : `` I wish I had a 9 to 5 job instead of the nightmare I 'm living . This is 24/7 . I do n't even want to do taping the show anymore . '' What 's your reaction to that ? Gosselin : Jon 's opinions and his goals are his . I know that , personally , for myself and the kids , this has been a good experience . It continues to be a good experience . And , you know , really the network has been extremely supportive , above and beyond , I feel , what they need to be . And I only experience good things . Everyone works . Everyone has a job . Everyone has what they 're dealing with . And , generally speaking , this is the most flexible , workable , wonderful job for myself . King : How long have you been doing it now ? Gosselin : We are in season 5 . We started filming in August of 2005 . King : Why is it such a good thing to have a private life public ? Gosselin : It 's been a source of huge -- for whatever reason -- inspiration for a lot of people . Many , many people -- many parents feel that their decisions are , maybe not , great decisions . Every parent has that , you know , parent guilt of my goal is to produce wonderful , productive individuals and put them out into society . That is the goal of a parent -- for us to show the world that we are not perfect , life is unpredictable , but life always goes on and there 's always , always , always something to look forward to . And for me , that is raising my children to the best of my ability . King : But as an intelligent person , you also know to all good things , there are downsides . Gosselin : Absolutely . With every positive , there is a negative across the board in life . It 's about choosing to see the positive and working with the negative . King : So what happens now ?

Publishers in Japan were quick to see the potential of putting cellphone novels into print . The 22-year-old who would rather be identified by his pen name than his real one -LRB- Yume-Hotaru means `` Dreaming Firefly '' in Japanese -RRB- started composing the novel on his cell phone in 2007 . Between classes , on the bus or before going to bed at night , he would type single sentences into his phone 's tiny keypad , uploading each one straight to the mobile social networking site Mobage-town . The more Yume-Hotaru posted , the more popular his story became . It won a prize and soon publishers approached him , asking if he wanted to turn his digital book into a paper one . By early 2008 , his novel `` First Experience , '' a story about love and sex in high school , was a top title in one of Tokyo 's biggest bookstores . Since it emerged in Japan nearly a decade ago , the cell phone novel , or keitai shosetsu , has moved from a little-known subgenre to a mainstream literary phenomenon . Keitai shosetsu sites boast billions of monthly users while publishers sell millions of copies of cellular stories taken from phones and turned into paperback . It is even spreading to other countries as other cultures start to take part in a type of composition long considered purely Japanese . As the name suggests , cell phone novels are written entirely on handsets and posted on sites like Maho no i-rando -LRB- Magic Island -RRB- , the first and largest mobile novel portal in Japan . The site has a million titles , 3.5 billion monthly visitors and six million registered users , according to the company . Mobile readers instantly see new chapters as they are added , often adding comments about the direction they think a novel should take . The diary-like stories are written and read mostly by young women in their teens and 20 's . Many authors use pen names and claim their stories are at least partially autobiographical . The novels often center on themes that are rarely discussed aloud in Japanese society -- drugs , sex , pregnancy , abortion , rape and disease . `` When they write those novels , they share their secret , personal problems , and when they read by mobile phones , they can hide what they are reading , '' explained Toshie Takahashi , an associate professor of media studies at Rikkyo University in Tokyo . `` They are also involved and engaged with their mobile phones very strongly , '' added Takahashi , noting that 96 percent of high school students own a cell phone in Japan . `` The mobile phone itself is embedded in young people 's everyday lives very deeply and also emotionally and physically . '' Despite its popularity among young women , a male writer known as Yoshi , widely considered the first cellular novelist , brought the burgeoning genre to light when he self-published `` Deep Love '' in 2002 . The story about a prostitute in Tokyo sold nearly 3 million copies and was adapted for film , television and Manga , or Japanese comics . Publishing phenomenon A struggling Japanese publishing industry was quick to take notice of the growing popularity of keitai shosetsu , especially early works like Yoshi 's `` Deep Love . '' Many of the popular cell phone novels have since been turned into paperbacks , and bookstores across Japan now have entire sections devoted to the digital-age literary genre .

Eventually , he found a plastic surgeon to help him , and his physical changes were complete by 1949 , but his family rejected him . The British tabloids hounded him . To escape publicity , he was forced to carve out a life for himself virtually alone . He became a Buddhist monk , and died in Tibet in 1962 at the age of 47 . His name was Michael Dillon , and he one of the Western world 's first transsexual people , that is , someone who changes sex and/or gender by medical means . His extensive writings were suppressed and destroyed by his family -- only fragments survive . By 1988 , when I began my transition -LRB- just before my 40th birthday -RRB- , there was scarcely more information about female-to-male transsexualism available than there was in 1949 . Even in the early 1990s , doctors told transsexual people that we should not socialize together , because people might notice there were things about us that were different from `` normal '' people . Many transsexual women were tall and some had broad shoulders , large hands and feet . Most transsexual men were on the short side , and had small hands and feet . It 's one thing if you mix in with other people where there is a lot of physical diversity , but if you congregate with others like you , you may risk discovery . To be discovered as a transsexual person was a horrible fate . And fitting in , being `` normal , '' was the goal of treatment , after all . I was convinced that having a `` sex change '' was going to be a very straightforward process . I would take the hormones , have some surgery , and then go home and mow my lawn . I expected life to just be ordinary , just the way it was supposed to be . There were a few surprises in store for me , though , not the least of which was that I learned that the fear and shame of being known or discovered to be a transsexual person was probably responsible for a tremendous amount of suffering . I learned that people like me hid themselves from the world , often were under-employed or unemployed , avoided seeing physicians when they were ill , and often expected that they would never have intimate partners . After I began transition , I met more and more transsexual men like myself , and I saw firsthand the fear and shame that limited their lives . These were kind , gentle , thoughtful , serious men , and they did not deserve to live in a state of fear and shame . I knew then that education about who we were , and what our lives were like , would be absolutely necessary to do two things : first to let people like me know we were not alone and we did n't have to be afraid ; and second to let other people know we existed , to make the world safe for us , for our difference and our uniqueness . Like a handful of other trans men in North America , Europe , England , and Japan , I began to do public education , to write about our experience , and to educate legislators and policy makers"],

Each week or month that passes , it seems , brings news of an aging veteran succumbing before DeJonge can find the time and money to photograph him . Not long ago , he said , two Jamaicans who fought with the British during World War I died . The last known German , French and Austro-Hungarian veterans died in the last year as well . `` These are the last of the last , '' he said . DeJonge said he became interested in photographing war veterans in 1996 , when he worked on a project to chronicle U.S. veterans of several wars . The subjects included two men who served during World War I .

Attorney Jonathan Reiter said his clients are seeking `` damages for terrorism , war crimes ... and wrongful death . '' The plaintiffs are asking for $ 10 million in compensatory damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit . Earlier this year , Chiquita , as part of a plea agreement , admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia , or AUC . AUC was named a terrorist organization by the United States in 2002 , making it a crime to give them money . The lawsuit alleges Chiquita 's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group . `` They conspired with the AUC , aided and abetted them in a far-reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing , distribution and sale , '' Reiter said . The attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm `` for pennies '' and were killed by AUC in 2001 , and other murder victims had been directed to `` sell their bananas only to Chiquita . '' The families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home country , he said . `` The principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists , when you put guns into the hands of terrorists , then you are legally responsible for the atrocities , the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit , '' Reiter said .

More than 2,000 are already on the job , and the program is growing every day , said Christopher White , a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration . `` What the officers are looking for are physiological signs that can not be manipulated that indicate stress , fear or deception , '' White said . `` We find bad people everyday with behavior detection officers .

`` Li Cheng '' from Shanghai . Li , a student at the University of Hong Kong , did not want to disclose his real name or details about his study program , fearing consequences back home . `` I live in one country , but it feels like having two identities , '' Li said . `` In Shanghai , I use special software to access sites blacklisted by the government , like Twitter or the uncensored version of Google . `` In Hong Kong , I am taught to integrate these tools in my research . '' In the past , students such as Li would have to travel to far-away countries to get around Beijing 's control of information . Now , they are taking advantage of Hong Kong 's special administrative status that allows for a `` one country , two systems '' rule until 2047 . Hong Kong is nothing like mainland China in terms of its free flow of information , freedom of speech and multiparty political system . Those differences were recently emphasized by Google 's row with the Chinese government over censorship . In March , Google announced it was routing its users to an uncensored version of the internet search engine based in Hong Kong , amid speculation that Google would pull out of China entirely . China 's reaction to Google 's announcement `` When Google redirected its site from China to Hong Kong , it meant a lot of publicity for our free harbor , '' said David Bandurski , a China analyst at the University of Hong Kong -LRB- HKU -RRB- . He studies censorship issues . '' -LSB- Google 's -RSB- move has emphasized Hong Kong 's significance in China , benefiting from the rule of law and its potential as a free information hub . '' Many young Chinese have explored that hub since 1997 when the the British colony was handed over to China , paving the way for Chinese from the mainland to apply to universities in Hong Kong . The influx of students applying from the mainland created fierce competition to enter Hong Kong 's top universities . The number of mainland Chinese applying for HKU 's undergraduate program has increased more than tenfold in the past decade . In 2008 , some 12,000 mainlanders applied for the 300 slots that HKU reserves for students from mainland China . Li Cheng said he considers himself very lucky to be studying in Hong Kong `` Free access to information is a need and a privilege , '' he said . The influx of talent such as Li could signify a brain drain for mainland China , according to Bandurski . `` Without political reform , economic growth in China will decline , '' he said . `` Talents will leave China . Students and teachers who want to have more access to information are not dissidents anymore . They are becoming the mainstream . '' Asia 's top five universities are now located in Hong Kong , Singapore and Japan -- outstripping their rivals in mainland China -- according to a recent ranking of QS , a higher education information network company . The top mainland school was Peking University in Beijing in 12th place , down from its previous ranking of 10 . See Asian university rankings The data show that `` the tide has turned , '' according to Paul Denlinger , an internet consultant based in Hong Kong and Beijing . `` During the dotcom era -LSB- of the 1990s -RSB- , head-hunters were looking for talent from universities in Shanghai and Beijing , '' Denlinger said . `` Now they are coming to Hong Kong .
